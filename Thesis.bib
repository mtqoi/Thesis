abstract = {We present a characterization of topological phases in photonic lattices. Our theory relies on a formal equivalence between the singular value decomposition of the non-Hermitian coupling matrix and the diagonalization of an effective Hamiltonian. By means of that mapping we unveil an application of topological band theory to the description of quantum amplification with non-reciprocal systems. We exemplify our ideas with an array of photonic cavities which can be mapped into a topological insulator Hamiltonian in the AIII symmetry class. We investigate stability properties and prove the existence of stable topologically non-trivial steady-state phases. Finally, we show numerically that the topological amplification process is robust against disorder in the lattice parameters.},

Since proposed by Andersson et al. [Phys. Rev. A 93, 032325 (2016)], a quantum digital signature protocol using an insecure channel has been realized with several different quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Here we report an experimental QDS based on a BB84 QKD system. An asymmetric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson interferometer structure has been designed in our system, which is intrinsi-cally stable against channel disturbance. The innovatory structure supports the system to work at high speed and, in practice, the repetition rate is in gigahertz. A 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 25 dB channel loss composed of a 25 km installed fiber with additional optical attenuation in a 10 −10 security level. Thus, our QDS device is stable and highly efficient. This Letter provides a further step for the practical application of QDS. The digital signature is an important cryptographic scheme, and it is widely used in modern telecommunication. In digital signature, a message will be signed with the authentication of a legitimate user, which ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeabil-ity, and transferability of the message. Most of the classical digital signature schemes, such as Rivest, Shamir, and Aldeman [1]; digital signature algorithm (DSA) [2]; and elliptic curve DSA [3], depend on the computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers or finding discrete logarithms. The assumptions of computational difficulty will not be valid with the advent of quantum computers. The digital signature schemes which remain secure in the age of quantum computation are urgently needed. In 2001, the first quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme was proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [4]. However, the scheme requires long-time quantum memory, nondestructive state comparison , and a secure quantum channel, which are all impractical in experiment. Then different QDS protocols have been proposed [5-9]. References [10] and [11] reported the QDS experiment without the requirement of nondestructive state comparison and quantum memory, respectively. However, they still require a secure quantum channel.

Recently, the QDS schemes [14,15] which do not require the secure quantum channel have been proposed, and several experiments have been reported based on BB84 [16], differential phase shift (DPS) [17,18], measurement-device-independent (MDI) [19-21] quantum key distribution (QKD) devices.

Compared with the previous QDS experiments , our scheme provides a tradeoff among the practical security , high rate and the stabilization of the QDS system. Here we only consider the QDS among three parties. QDS among more parties is possible with the consideration of concluding adversaries [23].

abstract = {Quantum digital signatures (QDS) provide a means for signing electronic communications with informationtheoretic security. However, all previous demonstrations of quantum digital signatures assume trusted measurement devices. This renders them vulnerable against detector side-channel attacks, just like quantum key distribution. Here, we exploit a measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum network, over a 200-square-kilometer metropolitan area, to perform a field test of a three-party measurement-device-independent quantum digital signature (MDI-QDS) scheme that is secure against any detector side-channel attack. In so doing, we are able to successfully sign a binary message with a security level of about 1E-7. Remarkably, our work demonstrates the feasibility of MDI-QDS for practical applications.},

Currently used "classical" signature schemes rely on unproven computational assumptions for security, while quantum signatures rely only on the laws of quantum mechanics. Previous quantum signature schemes have used unambiguous quantum measurements. Such measurements, however, sometimes give no result, reducing the efficiency of the protocol. Here, we instead use heterodyne detection, which always gives a result, although there is always some uncertainty. We experimentally demonstrate feasibility in a real environment by distributing signature states through a noisy 1.6km free-space channel. Our results show that continuous-variable heterodyne detection improves the signature rate for this type of scheme and therefore represents an interesting direction in the search for practical quantum signature schemes.},

Currently used classical digital signature schemes, however, only offer security relying on unproven computational assumptions. In contrast, quantum digital signatures offer information-theoretic security based on laws of quantum mechanics. Here, security against forging relies on the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing between nonorthogonal quantum states. A serious drawback of previous quantum digital signature schemes is that they require long-term quantum memory, making them impractical at present.We present the first realization of a scheme that does not need quantum memory and which also uses only standard linear optical components and photodetectors. In our realization, the recipients measure the distributed quantum signature states using a new type of quantum measurement, quantum state elimination.

We then define the residual Gaussian steering, stemming from the monogamy inequality, as an indicator of collective steering-type correlations. For pure three-mode Gaussian states, the residual acts a quantifier of genuine multipartite steering, and is interpreted operationally in terms of the guaranteed key rate in the task of secure quantum secret sharing. Optimal resource states for the latter protocol are identified, and their possible experimental implementation discussed.

abstract = {The shot-noise unit in continuous-variable quantum key distribution plays an important and fundamental role in experimental implementation as it is used as a normalization parameter that contribute to perform security analysis and distill the key information. However, the traditional calibration procedure and detector model can not cover all system noise in practical application, which will result in some loopholes and influence the practical security. What's more, the traditional procedure is also rather complicated and has difficulty in compatible with automatic operating system. In this paper we propose a calibration model based on the proposed trusted detector model, which could naturally close the loopholes in practical application. It can help identify the shot-noise unit in only one step, which can not only effectively simplify the evaluation process but also reduce the statistical fluctuation, while two steps are needed in traditional method. We prove its feasibility and derive the complete version of the corresponding entanglement-based model. Detailed security analysis against arbitrary collective attacks and numerous simulation results in both the asymptotic limit regime and the finite-size regime are provided. A proof-of-principle experiment has been implemented and the results indicate that the one-time-calibration model can be employed as a powerful substitution to calibrate the shot-noise unit. Our method paves the way for the deployment of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with real time calibration and automatic operation.},

abstract = {A long-term intervention (2.69 years) with an antioxidant diet, behavioral enrichment, or the combined treatment preserved and improved cognitive function in aged canines. Although each intervention alone provided cognitive benefits, the combination treatment was additive. We evaluate the hypothesis that antioxidants, enrichment, or the combination intervention reduces age-related beta-amyloid (A beta) neuropathology, as one mechanism mediating observed functional improvements. Measures assessed were A beta neuropathology in plaques, biochemically extractable A beta(40) and A beta(42) species, soluble oligomeric forms of A beta, and various proteins in the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing pathway. The strongest and most consistent effects on A beta pathology were observed in animals receiving the combined antioxidant and enrichment treatment. Specifically, A beta plaque load was significantly decreased in several brain regions, soluble A beta(42) was decreased selectively in the frontal cortex, and a trend for lower A beta oligomer levels was found in the parietal cortex. Reductions in A beta may be related to shifted APP processing toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway, because alpha-secretase enzymatic activity was increased in the absence of changes in beta-secretase activity. Although enrichment alone had no significant effects on A beta, reduced A beta load and plaque maturation occurred in animals receiving antioxidants as a component of treatment. A beta measures did not correlate with cognitive performance on any of the six tasks assessed, suggesting that modulation of A beta alone may be a relatively minor mechanism mediating cognitive benefits of the interventions. Overall, the data indicate that multidomain treatments may be a valuable intervention strategy to reduce neuropathology and improve cognitive function in humans.},

While messaging with these types of security guarantees are routinely performed in the modern digital world, current technologies only offer security under computational assumptions.

abstract = {In the standard model of quantum secret sharing, typically, one is interested in minimal authorized sets for the reconstruction of the secret. In such a setting, reconstruction requires the communication of all the shares of the corresponding authorized set. If we allow for non-minimal authorized sets, then we can trade off the size of the authorized sets with the amount of communication required for reconstruction. Based on the staircase codes, proposed by Bitar and El Rouayheb, we propose a class of quantum threshold secret sharing schemes that are also communication efficient. We call them {\$}((k,2k-1,d)){\$} communication efficient quantum secret sharing schemes where {\$}k{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}leq d{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}leq2k-1{\$}. Using the proposed construction, we can recover a secret of {\$}d-k+1{\$} qudits by communicating {\$}d{\$} qudits whereas using the standard {\$}((k,2k-1)){\$} quantum secret sharing requires {\$}k(d-k+1){\$} qudits to be communicated. In other words, to share a secret of one qudit, the standard quantum secret sharing requires {\$}k{\$} qudits whereas the proposed schemes communicate only $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}frac{\{}d{\}}{\{}d-k+1{\}}{\$} qudits per qudit in the communication complexity. Proposed schemes can reduce communication overheads by a factor {\$}O(k){\$} with respect to standard schemes, when {\$}d{\$} equals {\$}2k-1{\$}. Further, we show that our schemes have optimal communication cost for secret reconstruction.},

abstract = {The ability to distribute secret keys between two parties with information-theoretic security, that is, regardless of the capacities of a malevolent eavesdropper, is one of the most celebrated results in the field of quantum information processing and communication. Indeed, quantum key distribution illustrates the power of encoding information on the quantum properties of light and has far reaching implications in high-security applications. Today, quantum key distribution systems operate in real-world conditions and are commercially available. As with most quantum information protocols, quantum key distribution was first designed for qubits, the individual quanta of information. However, the use of quantum continuous variables for this task presents important advantages with respect to qubit based protocols, in particular from a practical point of view, since it allows for simple implementations that require only standard telecommunication technology. In this review article, we describe the principle of continuous-variable quantum key distribution, focusing in particular on protocols based on coherent states. We discuss the security of these protocols and report on the state-of-the-art in experimental implementations, including the issue of side-channel attacks. We conclude with promising perspectives in this research field.},

Networks using quantum resources with tailor-made entanglement structures have been proposed for a variety of tasks, including distributing, sharing and processing information. Recently, a class of states known as graph states has emerged, providing versatile quantum resources for such networking tasks. Here we report an experimental demonstration of graph state-based quantum secret sharing-an important primitive for a quantum network with applications ranging from secure money transfer to multiparty quantum computation. We use an all-optical setup, encoding quantum information into photons representing a five-qubit graph state. We find that one can reliably encode, distribute and share quantum information amongst four parties, with various access structures based on the complex connectivity of the graph. Our results show that graph states are a promising approach for realising sophisticated multi-layered communication protocols in quantum networks.},

abstract = {Quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes without entanglement have huge advantages in scalability and are easier to realize as they only require sequential communications of a single quantum system. However, these schemes often come with drawbacks such as exact (n; n) structure, flaws in security and in lack of effective cheating detection, which need urgent optimizations. To address this, we propose a verifiable framework of utilizing entanglement-free states to construct (t; n)-QSS schemes. Our work is the first step towards perfect security in entanglement-free QSS, and it sheds light on how to establish effective verification mechanism against cheating. As a result, the proposed framework has a significant importance in constructing QSS schemes for versatile applications in quantum networks due to its intrinsic scalability, flexibility and perfect security.},

We derive a security proof based on quantum key distribution, demonstrating our QSS protocol to be secure against both eavesdropping and dishonest participants.

Currently used classical digital signature schemes, however, only offer security relying on unproven computational assumptions. In contrast, quantum digital signatures offer information-theoretic security based on laws of quantum mechanics. Here, security against forging relies on the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing between nonorthogonal quantum states. A serious drawback of previous quantum digital signature schemes is that they require long-term quantum memory, making them impractical at present. We present the first realization of a scheme that does not need quantum memory and which also uses only standard linear optical components and photodetectors. In our realization, the recipients measure the distributed quantum signature states using a new type of quantum measurement, quantum state elimination. This significantly advances quantum digital signatures as a quantum technology with potential for real applications.},

After dissection of the serosa of the dorsal and ventral sides of the gall bladder, including Calot's triangle, the angled tip of the hook cautery is inserted between the cystic artery and duct with its tip placed dorsally. The tip is then rotated in a clockwise manner to avoid bile duct injury, allowing the connective tissue between them to be hooked, coagulated and cut. This procedure is repeated several times, followed by dissection between the cystic artery and the liver bed to achieve a critical view. From December 2008 to May 2011, 121 patients underwent SILC using HRT in our hospital without any serious complications. This technique is suitable for SILC, as it is consists of simple procedures that can be performed safely and easily, even by left hand in a cross-over approach, and it allows complete dissection of Calot's triangle to achieve a critical view without using any dissector under dangerous in-line viewing.},

abstract = {We investigate the concept of quantum secret sharing. In a ((k,n)) threshold scheme, a secret quantum state is divided into n shares such that any k of those shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but any set of k-1 or fewer shares contains absolutely no information about the secret. We show that the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum "no-cloning theorem", which requires that n {\textless} 2k, and, in all such cases, we give an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) threshold scheme. We also explore similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k {\textless}= n {\textless} 2k-1 then any ((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state.},

Currently used classical digital signature schemes rely on public key encryption techniques, where the complexity of so-called 'one-way' mathematical functions is used to provide security over sufficiently long timescales. No mathematical proofs are known for the long-term security of such techniques. Quantum digital signatures offer a means of sending a message, which cannot be forged or repudiated, with security verified by information-theoretical limits and quantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate an experimental system, which distributes quantum signatures from one sender to two receivers and enables message sending ensured against forging and repudiation. Additionally, we analyse the security of the system in some typical scenarios. Our system is based on the interference of phase-encoded coherent states of light and our implementation utilizes polarization-maintaining optical fibre and photons with a wavelength of 850 nm.},

abstract = {Topological photonics is a rapidly emerging field of research in which geometrical and topological ideas are exploited to design and control the behavior of light. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit QED. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

abstract = {A novel treatment of dissipation of energy from a "small" quantum system to a reservoir is presented. {\%}'e replace the usual master equation for the small-system density matrix by a wave function evolution including a stochastic element. This wave-function approach provides new insight and it allows calculations on problems which would otherwise be exceedingly complicated. The approach is applied here to a two-or three-level atom coupled to a laser field and to the vacuum modes of the quantized electromagnetic field. A typical model system in quantum optics consists of an atom coupled simultaneously to a laser field and to the vacuum modes of the quantized electromagnetic field. The atom-laser interaction, responsible for absorption and stimulated emission processes, is coherent, whereas the coupling between the atom and the vacuum modes, responsible for spontaneous emission processes, is fundamentally incoherent. This leads to a dissipation of energy from the "small system" (atom+ laser) to the "reservoir" (vacuum field), which is usually treated by a density operator approach. A master equation, usually referred to as the optical Bloch equations (OBE's), is written for the reduced atomic density matrix pz [1]. We present here an alternative approach using a wave-function treatment to describe the atomic system. The apparent incompatibility between such a wave-function approach and the inherent irreversibility of the spontaneous processes is lifted by introducing repeated "gedanken measurements" on the atomic system simulating the detection of the spontaneous photons. The random result of each of these measurements determines the atomic state afterwards, and is at the origin of the ir-reversibility. We show that this treatment is equivalent to the standard density matrix approach leading to the OBE's. There are two main interests in this approach. First, it gives new insights into the processes taking place in the interaction of an atom with light. Here we will give two examples concerning the Rabi transitory regime for a two-level atom and the "dark resonance" problem. Second, it provides an efficient computational tool. If we consider an atomic system with N states, the master equation treatment requires the simultaneous solution of W OBE's, while in this new approach, we deal with wave functions and we have to look for the evolution of no more than W variables. For instance, in problems related to a quantum treatment of laser cooling, N includes both the number of internal and external atomic states and can be very large. This makes the density matrix approach unwieldy except for simple one-dimensional configura},

abstract = {Conventional strategies of quantum metrology are built upon POVMs, thereby possessing several general features, including the demolition of the state to be measured, the need of performing a number of measurements, and the degradation of performance under decoherence and dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative measurement scheme, called dissipative adiabatic measurements (DAMs), based on which, we further develop an approach to estimation of parameters characterizing dissipative processes. Unlike a POVM, whose outcome is one of the eigenvalues of an observable, a DAM yields the expectation value of the observable as its outcome, without collapsing the state to be measured. By virtue of the very nature of DAMs, our approach is capable of solving the estimation problem in a state-protective fashion with only {\$}M{\$} measurements, where {\$}M{\$} is the number of parameters to be estimated. More importantly, contrary to the common wisdom, it embraces decoherence and dissipation as beneficial effects and offers a Heisenberg-like scaling of precision, thus outperforming conventional strategies. Our DAM-based approach is direct, efficient, and expected to be immensely useful in the context of dissipative quantum information processing.},

The innovatory structure supports the system to work at high speed and, in practice, the repetition rate is in gigahertz. A 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 25 dB channel loss composed of a 25 km installed fiber with additional optical attenuation in a 10 −10 security level. Thus, our QDS device is stable and highly efficient. This Letter provides a further step for the practical application of QDS. The digital signature is an important cryptographic scheme, and it is widely used in modern telecommunication. In digital signature, a message will be signed with the authentication of a legitimate user, which ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeabil-ity, and transferability of the message. Most of the classical digital signature schemes, such as Rivest, Shamir, and Aldeman [1]; digital signature algorithm (DSA) [2]; and elliptic curve DSA [3], depend on the computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers or finding discrete logarithms. The assumptions of computational difficulty will not be valid with the advent of quantum computers. The digital signature schemes which remain secure in the age of quantum computation are urgently needed. In 2001, the first quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme was proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [4]. However, the scheme requires long-time quantum memory, nondestructive state comparison , and a secure quantum channel, which are all impractical in experiment. Then different QDS protocols have been proposed [5-9]. References [10] and [11] reported the QDS experiment without the requirement of nondestructive state comparison and quantum memory, respectively. However, they still require a secure quantum channel. Then Refs. [12,13] realized QDS in kilometer range with the assumption of a secure quantum channel. Recently, the QDS schemes [14,15] which do not require the secure quantum channel have been proposed, and several experiments have been reported based on BB84 [16], differential phase shift (DPS) [17,18], measurement-device-independent (MDI) [19-21] quantum key distribution (QKD) devices. Here we report an experimental QDS based on an asym-metric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson BB84 QKD system [22], which is intrinsically stable against channel disturbance and high-speed support. In addition, the phase-encoding states are used in our scheme. With the consideration of the finite effect, 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 10 −10 security level and 25 dB channel loss. Compared with the previous QDS experiments , our scheme provides a tradeoff among the practical security , high rate and the stabilization of the QDS system. Here we only consider the QDS among three parties. QDS among more parties is possible with the consideration of concluding adversaries [23]. In a three-party scenario, we assume that there is only one party that is dishonest at most. Specifically, our QDS protocol has two stages, a distribution stage and a messaging stage. In the distribution stage, Bob sends a group of weak coherent state pulses (randomly in X or Z Letter Vol. 44, No.},

Despite their far-reaching use in modern communication, currently used signature schemes rely on computational assumptions and will be rendered insecure by a quantum computer. We present a quantum digital signatures (QDS) scheme whose security is instead based on the impossibility of perfectly and deterministically distinguishing between quantum states. Our continuous-variable (CV) scheme relies on phase measurement of a distributed alphabet of coherent states, and allows for secure message authentication against a quantum adversary performing collective beamsplitter and entangling-cloner attacks. Crucially, for the first time in the CV setting we allow for an eavesdropper on the quantum channels and yet retain shorter signature lengths than previous protocols with no eavesdropper. This opens up the possibility to implement CV QDS alongside existing CV quantum key distribution (QKD) platforms with minimal modification.},

We analyze the security of two variants of CV-QKD protocol with quaternary modulation against collective attacks in the asymptotic limit. Our security analysis is based on the numerical optimization of the asymptotic key rate formula with a photon number cutoff assumption that truncates the dimension of the system. When the cutoff photon number is chosen to be sufficiently large, our results do not depend on the specific choice of cutoff. Our analysis shows that this protocol can achieve much higher key rates over long distances compared with binary and ternary modulation schemes and yield key rates comparable to Gaussian modulation schemes. Furthermore, our security analysis method allows us to evaluate variations of the discrete-modulated protocols, including direct and reverse reconciliation, and also postselection strategies. We also demonstrate that postselection in combination with reverse reconciliation can improve the key rates.},

abstract = {: Digital signatures are one of the most important cryptographic primitives. In this work we construct an information-theoretically secure signature scheme which, unlike prior schemes, enjoys a number of advantageous properties such as short signature length and high generation efficiency, to name two. In particular, we extend symmetric-key message authentication codes (MACs) based on universal hashing to make them transferable, a property absent from traditional MAC schemes. Our main results are summarised as follows. - We construct an unconditionally secure signature scheme which, unlike prior schemes, does not rely on a trusted third party or anonymous channels. In our scheme, a sender shares with each of the remaining protocol participants (or recipients) a set of keys (or hash functions) from a family of universal hash functions. Also, the recipients share with each other a random portion of the keys that they share with the sender. A signature for a message is a vector of tags generated by applying the hash functions to the message. As such, our scheme can be viewed as an extension of MAC schemes, and therefore, the practical implementation of our scheme is straightforward. - We prove information-theoretic security of our scheme against forging, repudiation, and non-transferability. - We compare our schemes with existing both "classical" (not employing quantum mechanics) and quantum unconditionally secure signature schemes. The comparison shows that our new scheme has a number of unparalleled advantages over the previous schemes. - Finally, although our scheme does not rely on trusted third parties, we discuss this, showing that having a trusted third party makes our scheme even more attractive.},

abstract = {Suppose that Alice and Bob are located in distant laboratories, which are connected by an ideal quantum channel. Suppose further that they share many copies of a quantum state $\rho$ABE, such that Alice possesses the A systems and Bob the BE systems. In our model, there is an identifiable part of Bob's laboratory that is insecure: a third party named Eve has infiltrated Bob's laboratory and gained control of the E systems. Alice, knowing this, would like use their shared state and the ideal quantum channel to communicate a message in such a way that Bob, who has access to the whole of his laboratory (BE systems), can decode it, while Eve, who has access only to a sector of Bob's laboratory (E systems) and the ideal quantum channel connecting Alice to Bob, cannot learn anything about Alice's transmitted message. We call this task the conditional one-time pad, and in this paper, we prove that the optimal rate of secret communication for this task is equal to the conditional quantum mutual information I(A; B|E) of their shared state. We thus give the conditional quantum mutual information an operational meaning that is different from those given in prior works, via state redistribution, conditional erasure, or state deconstruction. We also generalize the model and method in several ways, one of which demonstrates that the negative tripartite interaction information −I3(A; B; E) ≡ I(A; BE) − I(A; B) − I(A; E) of a tripartite state $\rho$ABE is an achievable rate for a secret-sharing task, i.e., the case in which Alice's message should be secure from someone possessing only the AB or AE systems but should be decodable by someone possessing all systems A, B, and E. Introduction—The main purpose of this paper is to show that the optimal rate of a communication task, which we call the conditional one-time pad, is equal to a fundamental information quantity called the conditional quantum mutual information. To prove this statement, we operate in the regime of quantum Shannon theory, and we suppose that Alice and Bob possess a large num-ber n of copies of a quantum state $\rho$ ABE . We suppose that one party Alice has access to all of the A systems, and another party Bob has access to all of the BE sys-tems. We suppose that Bob's laboratory is divided into two parts, one of which is secure (the B part) and the other which is insecure (the E part) and accessible to an eavesdropper Eve. We also suppose that Alice and Bob are connected by an ideal quantum channel, but the eavesdropper Eve can observe any quantum system that is transmitted over the ideal channel if she so desires. The goal of a conditional quantum one-time pad proto-col is for Alice to encode a message m into her A systems, in such a way that if she sends her A systems over the ideal quantum channel, then 1. Bob can decode the message m reliably by per-forming a measurement on all of the ABE systems, while},

Indeed, techniques based on the uncertainty principle are not known to work for such protocols, and the usual tools based on de Finetti reductions only provide security for unrealistically large block lengths. We address this problem here by considering a new type of Gaussian de Finetti reduction, that exploits the invariance of some continuous-variable protocols under the action of the unitary group {\$}U(n){\$} (instead of the symmetric group {\$}S{\_}n{\$} as in usual de Finetti theorems), and by introducing generalized {\$}SU(2,2){\$} coherent states. Our reduction shows that it is sufficient to prove the security of these protocols against Gaussian collective attacks in order to obtain security against general attacks, thereby confirming rigorously the widely held belief that Gaussian attacks are indeed optimal against such protocols.},

abstract = {We discuss quantum key distribution protocols using quantum continuous variables. We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent to the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the resistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure with high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol, even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in the absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual'' entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.},

Firstly, we design a quantum secret sharing protocol based on the Borras-Plastino-Batle (BPB) state. Departing from previous research, our protocol has a salient feature in that participants in our protocol only need projective measurement instead of any unitary operations. It makes our protocol more flexible. Secondly, universality of quantum communication protocols is studied for the first time. More specifically, module division of quantum communication protocols and coupling between different modules are discussed. Our aforementioned protocol is analyzed as an example. On one hand, plenty of quantum states (the BPB-class states and the BPB-like-class states, which are proposed in this paper) could be used as carrier to perform our protocol. On the other hand, our protocol also could be regarded as a quantum private comparison protocol with a little revision. These features are rare for quantum communication protocols, and make our protocol more robust. Thirdly, entanglements of the BPB-class states are calculated in the Appendix.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes key findings in single-photon generation from deep level defects in silicon carbide (SiC) and highlights the significance of these individually addressable centers for emerging quantum applications. Single photon emission from various defect centers in both bulk and nanostructured SiC are discussed as well as their formation and possible integration into optical and electrical devices. The related measurement protocols, the building blocks of quantum communication and computation network architectures in solid state systems, are also summarized. This includes experimental methodologies developed for spin control of different paramagnetic defects, including the measurement of spin coherence times. Well established doping, and micro- and nanofabrication procedures for SiC may allow the quantum properties of paramagnetic defects to be electrically and mechanically controlled efficiently. The integration of single defects into SiC devices is crucial for applications in quantum technologies and we will review progress in this direction.},

abstract = {Distribution of quantum correlations among remote users is a key procedure underlying many quantum in-formation technologies. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, which is one kind of such correlations stronger than entanglement, has been identified as a resource for secure quantum networks. We show that this resource can be established between two and even more distant parties by transmission of a system being separable from all the parties. For the case with two parties, we design a protocol allowing to distribute one-way Gaussian steering between them via a separable carrier; the obtained steering can be used subsequently for one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quantum key distribution. Further, we extend the protocol to three parties, a sce-nario which exhibits richer steerability properties including one-to-multimode steering and collective steering, and which can be used for 1sDI quantum secret sharing. All the proposed steering distribution protocols can be implemented with squeezed states, beam splitters and displacements, and thus they can be readily realized experimentally. Our findings reveal that not only entanglement but even steering can be distributed via commu-nication of a separable system. Viewed from a different perspective, the present protocols also demonstrate that one can switch multipartite states between different steerability classes by operations on parts of the states. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering was put forward by Schr{\"{o}}dinger [1] to describe the " spooky action-at-a-distance " phenomenon discussed in the original 1935 EPR paradox [2, 3], which allows one observer to remotely adjust ('steer') the state of another distant observer by local measure-ments. This special type of quantum correlations offers in-sights into directional nonlocality [4–14] and differs conceptu-ally from inseparable correlations aka entanglement [15, 16]. The fact that steering enables verification of shared entan-glement even when one party's measurements are untrusted [17–19] makes it an essential resource for a number of appli-cations, such as one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quan-tum key distribution (QKD) [20–23] and quantum secret shar-ing (QSS) [24–26], secure quantum teleportation [27–29], and subchannel discrimination [30, 31].},

It is therefore of immediate practical relevance to investigate quantum information processing with limited physical resources, for example to ask: How well can we perform information processing tasks if we only have access to a small quantum device? Can we beat fundamental limits imposed on information processing with classical resources? This book will introduce the reader to the mathematical framework required to answer such questions. The focus is on measures of entropy and information that underly finite resource information theory, in particular Renyi and smooth entropies. We will review quantum generalizations of Renyi entropies and discuss their properties in detail. Smooth entropies are variants of Renyi entropies that have found various applications ranging from quantum cryptography to thermodynamics. A particular goal of this book is to give simple and concise proofs of the most important properties of Renyi and smooth entropies. A few specific applications of the framework are discussed.},

In addition, for many applications, there is a quantum advantage if the single photons are indistinguishable in all their degrees of freedom. Single-photon sources based on parametric down-conversion are currently used, and while excellent in many ways, scaling to large quantum optical systems remains challenging. In 2000, semiconductor quantum dots were shown to emit single photons, opening a path towards integrated single-photon sources. Here, we review the progress achieved in the past few years, and discuss remaining challenges. The latest quantum dot-based single-photon sources are edging closer to the ideal single-photon source, and have opened new possibilities for quantum technologies.},

@article{Sasaki2014,
abstract = {Quantum cryptography exploits the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to provide a secure way to exchange private information. Such an exchange requires a common random bit sequence, called a key, to be shared secretly between the sender and the receiver. The basic idea behind quantum key distribution (QKD) has widely been understood as the property that any attempt to distinguish encoded quantum states causes a disturbance in the signal. As a result, implementation of a QKD protocol involves an estimation of the experimental parameters influenced by the eavesdropper's intervention, which is achieved by randomly sampling the signal. If the estimation of many parameters with high precision is required, the portion of the signal that is sacrificed increases, thus decreasing the efficiency of the protocol. Here we propose a QKD protocol based on an entirely different principle. The sender encodes a bit sequence onto non-orthogonal quantum states and the receiver randomly dictates how a single bit should be calculated from the sequence. The eavesdropper, who is unable to learn the whole of the sequence, cannot guess the bit value correctly. An achievable rate of secure key distribution is calculated by considering complementary choices between quantum measurements of two conjugate observables. We found that a practical implementation using a laser pulse train achieves a key rate comparable to a decoy-state QKD protocol, an often-used technique for lasers. It also has a better tolerance of bit errors and of finite-sized-key effects. We anticipate that this finding will give new insight into how the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics can be related to secure communication, and will facilitate the simple and efficient use of conventional lasers for QKD. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

A large fraction of the research effort in designing superconducting circuits has focused on noise reduction, with great success, as coherence times have increased by four orders of magnitude in the past two decades. However, noise and dissipation can never be fully eliminated, and further, a rapidly growing body of theoretical and experimental work has shown that carefully tuned noise, in the form of engineered dissipation, can be a profoundly useful tool in designing and operating quantum circuits. In this article, I review important applications of engineered dissipation, including state generation, state stabilization, and autonomous quantum error correction, where engineered dissipation can mitigate the effect of intrinsic noise, reducing logical error rates in quantum information processing. Further, I provide a pedagogical review of the basic noise processes in superconducting qubits (photon loss and phase noise), and argue that any dissipative mechanism which can correct photon loss errors is very likely to automatically suppress dephasing. I also discuss applications for quantum simulation, and possible future research directions.},

Impressive progress has been achieved in isolating quantum systems from the environment and coherently controlling their dynamics, as demonstrated by the creation and manipulation of entanglement in various physical systems. However, for open quantum systems, engineering the dynamics of many particles by a controlled coupling to an environment remains largely unexplored. Here we realize an experimental toolbox for simulating an open quantum system with up to five quantum bits (qubits). Using a quantum computing architecture with trapped ions, we combine multi-qubit gates with optical pumping to implement coherent operations and dissipative processes. We illustrate our ability to engineer the open-system dynamics through the dissipative preparation of entangled states, the simulation of coherent many-body spin interactions, and the quantum non-demolition measurement of multi-qubit observables. By adding controlled dissipation to coherent operations, this work offers novel prospects for open-system quantum simulation and computation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Sub-Poissonian processes are exemplified in different areas of optics, ranging from single-atom resonance fluorescence to nonlinear optics, laser physics, and cavity quantum electrodynamics. Emphasis is placed on the conceptual foundations, and on developments in laser theory that lead to the possibility, already demonstrated experimentally, of linewidth narrowing and sub-Poissonian light generation in lasers and masers. The sources of quantum noise in these devices are analyzed, and four noise-suppression methods are discussed in detail: regularization of the pumping, suppression of spontaneous-emission noise, nonadiabatic evolution of the atomic variables, and twin-beam generation.

abstract = {We study and solve the problem of distilling secret key from quantum states representing correlation between two parties (Alice and Bob) and an eavesdropper (Eve) via one-way public discussion: we prove a coding theorem to achieve the "wire-tapper" bound, the difference of the mutual information Alice-Bob and that of Alice-Eve, for so-called cqq-correlations, via one-way public communication. This result yields information--theoretic formulas for the distillable secret key, giving ``ultimate'' key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specialising our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one-way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so-called "hashing inequality" which says that the coherent information (i.e., the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable EPR rate. This result is well--known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity formulas which we briefly review.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 OSA. We present and demonstrate a novel protocol for distributing secret keys between two and only two parties based on N-party single-qubit Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS). We demonstrate our new protocol with N = 3 parties using phase-encoded photons. We show that any two out of N parties can build a secret key based on partial information from each other and with collaboration from the remaining N-2 parties. Our implementation allows for an accessible transition between N-party QSS and arbitrary two party QKD without modification of hardware. In addition, our approach significantly reduces the number of resources such as single photon detectors, lasers and dark fiber connections needed to implement QKD.},

Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of QDSs over installed optical fiber, as well as the longest transmission link reported to date.

abstract = {Quantum key distribution using weak coherent states and homodyne detection is a promising candidate for practical quantum-cryptographic implementations due to its compatibility with existing telecom equipment and high detection efficiencies. However, despite the actual simplicity of the protocol, the security analysis of this method is rather involved compared to discrete-variable QKD. In this article we review the theoretical foundations of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) with Gaussian modulation and rederive the essential relations from scratch in a pedagogical way. The aim of this paper is to be as comprehensive and self-contained as possible in order to be well intelligible even for readers with little pre-knowledge on the subject. Although the present article is a theoretical discussion of CV-QKD, its focus lies on practical implementations, taking into account various kinds of hardware imperfections and suggesting practical methods to perform the security analysis subsequent to the key exchange. Apart from a review of well known results, this manuscript presents a set of new original noise models which are helpful to get an estimate of how well a given set of hardware will perform in practice.},

Complementing with the earlier proposed semi-quantum schemes for key distribution, secret sharing and deterministic secure communication, set of schemes proposed here and subsequent discussions have established that almost every secure communication and computation tasks that can be performed using fully quantum protocols can also be performed in semi-quantum manner. Further, it addresses a fundamental question in context of a large number problems- how much quantumness is (how many quantum parties are) required to perform a specific secure communication task? Some of the proposed schemes are completely orthogonal-state-based, and thus, fundamentally different from the existing semi-quantum schemes that are conjugate-coding-based. Security, efficiency and applicability of the proposed schemes have been discussed with appropriate importance.},

@article{Amiri2015,
abstract = {Signature schemes, proposed in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, have become ubiquitous across modern communications. They allow for the exchange of messages from one sender to multiple recipients, with the guarantees that messages cannot be forged or tampered with and that messages also can be forwarded from one recipient to another without compromising their validity. Signatures are different from, but no less important than encryption, which ensures the privacy of a message. Commonly used signature protocols - signatures based on the Rivest-Adleman-Shamir (RSA) algorithm, the digital signature algorithm (DSA), and the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) - are only computationally secure, similar to public key encryption methods. In fact, since these rely on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithms or factoring large primes, it is known that they will become completely insecure with the emergence of quantum computers. We may therefore see a shift towards signature protocols that will remain secure even in a post-quantum world. Ideally, such schemes would provide unconditional or information-theoretic security. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible and comprehensive review of existing unconditionally secure signature schemes for signing classical messages, with a focus on unconditionally secure quantum signature schemes.},

This is a challenging goal, because it requires protocols that guarantee both unconditional security and high communication rates, while increasing the number of users. In this scenario, continuous-variable systems provide an ideal platform where high rates can be achieved by using off-the-shelf optical components. At the same time, the measurement-device independent architecture is also appealing for its feature of removing a substantial portion of practical weaknesses. Driven by these ideas, here we introduce a modular design of continuous-variable network where each individual module is a measurement-device-independent star network. In each module, the users send modulated coherent states to an untrusted relay, creating multipartite secret correlations via a generalized Bell detection. Using one-time pad between different modules, the network users may share a quantum-secure conference key over arbitrary distances at constant rate.},

We present a thorough and detailed security proof in the limit of infinite signal states which allows us to lower bound the secret key rate. We calculate this is in the context of collective eavesdropping attacks and reverse reconciliation postprocessing.

abstract = {A massive gap exists between current quantum computing (QC) prototypes, and the size and scale required for many proposed QC algorithms. Current QC implementations are prone to noise and variability which affect their reliability, and yet with less than 80 quantum bits (qubits) total, they are too resource-constrained to implement error correction. The term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) refers to these current and near-term systems of 1000 qubits or less. Given NISQ's severe resource constraints, low reliability, and high variability in physical characteristics such as coherence time or error rates, it is of pressing importance to map computations onto them in ways that use resources efficiently and maximize the likelihood of successful runs. This paper proposes and evaluates backend compiler approaches to map and optimize high-level QC programs to execute with high reliability on NISQ systems with diverse hardware characteristics. Our techniques all start from an LLVM intermediate representation of the quantum program (such as would be generated from high-level QC languages like Scaffold) and generate QC executables runnable on the IBM Q public QC machine. We then use this framework to implement and evaluate several optimal and heuristic mapping methods. These methods vary in how they account for the availability of dynamic machine calibration data, the relative importance of various noise parameters, the different possible routing strategies, and the relative importance of compile-time scalability versus runtime success. Using realsystem measurements, we show that fine grained spatial and temporal variations in hardware parameters can be exploited to obtain an average 2.9x (and up to 18x) improvement in program success rate over the industry standard IBM Qiskit compiler. Despite small qubit counts, NISQ systems will soon be large enough to demonstrate "quantum supremacy," i.e., an advantage over classical computing. Tools like ours provide significant improvements in program reliability and execution time, and offer high leverage in accelerating progress towards quantum supremacy.},

Our proposal provides not only superior efficiency, but also new insights on the connection between CSS-states and bipartite graph states. We then consider the applications of our distillation schemes for two cryptographic tasks--namely, (a) conference key agreement and (b) quantum sharing of classical secrets. In particular, we construct ``prepare-and-measure'' protocols. Also we study the yield of those protocols and the threshold value of the fidelity above which the protocols can function securely. Surprisingly, our protocols will function securely even when the initial state does not violate the standard Bell-inequalities for GHZ states. Experimental realization involving only bi-partite entanglement is also suggested.},

abstract = {Agile cryptography allows for a resource-efficient swap of a cryptographic core in case the security of an underlying classical cryptographic algorithm becomes compromised. In this paper, we suggest how this principle can be applied to the field of quantum cryptography. We explicitly demonstrate two quantum cryptographic protocols: quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform, with protocols only differing in their classical post-processing. The system is also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver, enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are inherently multipartite and we prove that they are secure not only when a player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external) eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In the first proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile quantum communication system, the quantum states were distributed at GHz rates. This allows for a one-bit message to be securely signed using our QDS protocols in less than {\$}0.05{\$}{\~{}}ms over a {\$}2{\$}{\~{}}km fiber link and in less than {\$}0.2{\$}{\~{}}s over a {\$}20{\$}{\~{}}km fiber link. To our knowledge, this also marks the first demonstration of a continuous-variable direct QSS protocol.},

We explore different linear optics networks - each one with optimised asymmetries - that create multipartite steerable states containing different numbers of quantised optical modes (qumodes). By introducing asymmetric loss on a 7-qumode state, we characterize 8 regimes of directional steering, showing that N + 1 regimes exist for an N-qumode state. Further, we reveal the directional monogamy of steering, and experimentally demonstrate continuous variable one-sided semi device-independent quantum secret sharing. Our methods establish principles for the development of multiparty quantum communication protocols with asymmetric observers, and can be extended to qubits, whether photonic, atomic, superconducting, or otherwise.},

The coupling to the environment drives the system to a steady state where the outcome of the computation is encoded. In a similar vein, we show that dissipation can be used to engineer a large variety of strongly correlated states in steady state, including all stabilizer codes, matrix product states4, and their generalization to higher dimensions5.},

abstract = {The science of quantum information has arisen over the last two decades centered on the manipulation of individual quanta of information, known as quantum bits or qubits. Quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation are among the most celebrated ideas that have emerged from this new field. It was realized later on that using continuous-variable quantum information carriers, instead of qubits, constitutes an extremely powerful alternative approach to quantum information processing. This review focuses on continuous-variable quantum information processes that rely on any combination of Gaussian states, Gaussian operations, and Gaussian measurements. Interestingly, such a restriction to the Gaussian realm comes with various benefits, since on the theoretical side, simple analytical tools are available and, on the experimental side, optical components effecting Gaussian processes are readily available in the laboratory. Yet, Gaussian quantum information processing opens the way to a wide variety of tasks and applications, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and quantum state and channel discrimination. This review reports on the state of the art in this field, ranging from the basic theoretical tools and landmark experimental realizations to the most recent successful developments.},

The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key cryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However, it is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature schemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has been explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security definitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty signature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical -- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature protocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case, proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability. Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.},

abstract = {Cryptographic protocols are the backbone of our information society. This includes two-party protocols which offer protection against distrustful players. Such protocols can be built from a basic primitive called oblivious transfer. We present and experimentally demonstrate here the first quantum protocol for oblivious transfer for optical continuous-variable systems, and prove its security in the noisy-storage model. This model allows to establish security by sending more quantum signals than an attacker can reliably store during the protocol. The security proof is based on new uncertainty relations which we derive for continuous-variable systems, that dif-fer from the ones used in quantum key distribution. We experimentally demonstrate the proposed oblivious transfer protocol for various channel losses by using entangled two-mode squeezed states measured with bal-anced homodyne detection. Our work enables the implementation of arbitrary two-party quantum cryptographic protocols with continuous-variable communication systems. Quantum cryptography can be used to perform crypto-graphic tasks with information theoretical security based on quantum mechanical principles. Most prominent is quan-tum key distribution (QKD), which allows to implement a communication link that provides theoretical security against eavesdropping [1–3]. Yet, there are other practically impor-tant cryptographic protocols such as oblivious transfer (OT), bit commitment, and secure password-based identification. In these so-called two-party protocols, two distrustful par-ties (Alice and Bob) engage and want to be ensured that the other party cannot cheat or maliciously influence the outcome. Hence, in contrast to QKD, security for these protocols needs not only be established against an outside attacker but even against a distrustful player.},

Starting from a nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation coupling with phonon modes that cause Raman noise, we develop a multimode quantum theory of nonlinear propagation in an optical fiber. Based on our proposed method, we numerically simulate fiber nonlinear propagation in two conditions: solitonlike and zero-group-delay-dispersion (zero-GVD) propagation. As a result, we find that zero-GVD propagation enables the large-scale parallel generation of squeezed states relative to solitonlike propagation owing to the broadband phase matching of the four-wave mixing process.},

abstract = {This chapter is devoted to the nonlinear effects occurring in four types of fiber interferometers. Four common fiber interferometers are the fiber versions of the well-known Fabry–Perot, Mach–Zehnder, Sagnac, and Michelson interferometers. They exhibit interesting nonlinear effects that are useful for optical-switching applications, when power levels are large enough for the nonlinear phenomenon of self–phase modulation (SPM) or cross-phase modulation (XPM) to become important. There are two fiber components covered that can be combined to form a variety of fiber-based optical devices. Fabry–Perot and ring resonators are well-known devices used commonly for making lasers. A fiber-based Fabry–Perot resonator can be constructed by simply making two ends of an optical fiber partially reflecting. This can be realized in practice by using external mirrors or by depositing high-reflectivity coatings at the two ends. This chapter explores the theory of modulation instability, including the effects of feedback occurring inside a fiber resonator. The analysis is quite involved in the case of a Fabry–Perot cavity since one must use the coupled NLS equations describing the evolution of the forward- and backward-propagating waves. By exploiting different nonlinear effects such as XPM, SPM, and four-wave mixing (FWM) occurring inside the fiber used to make the Sagnac loop, one can employ a nonlinear fiber-loop mirror for many practical applications.},

Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realise exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. In this article, we review experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide-range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics and circuit-QED. We discuss how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases, and we review progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading towards new collective phenomena and novel strongly-correlated states of light, such as an analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

In the three-mode design, our scheme emulates the third-order nonlinear absorption, allowing for generation of the single photon states, or the two-photon absorption allowing to generate the phase states. In the four-mode design, the scheme emulates a non-local absorption which produces an entangled state of two uncoupled modes. We also note that in the latter case and in the case of the phase states generation the output state is in the linear modes, which prevents its subsequent degradation by the strong losses accompanying the strong Kerr nonlinearity.},

To accomplish this task, each recipient of the message must have a copy of Alice's "public key," which is a set of quantum states whose exact identity is known only to Alice. Quantum public keys are more difficult to deal with than classical public keys: for instance, only a limited number of copies can be in circulation, or the scheme becomes insecure. However, in exchange for this price, we achieve unconditionally secure digital signatures. Sending an m-bit message uses up O(m) quantum bits for each recipient of the public key. We briefly discuss how to securely distribute quantum public keys, and show the signature scheme is absolutely secure using one method of key distribution.

The asymmetric phenomena of Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) steering plays a key role in one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. In the context of continuous-variable (CV) QKD schemes utilizing Gaussian states and measurements, we identify all protocols that can be 1sDI and their maximum loss tolerance. Surprisingly, this includes a protocol that uses only coherent states. We also establish a direct link between the relevant EPR steering inequality and the secret key rate, further strengthening the relationship between these asymmetric notions of nonlocality and device independence. We experimentally implement both entanglement-based and coherent-state protocols, and measure the correlations necessary for 1sDI key distribution up to an applied loss equivalent to 7.5 and 3.5 km of optical fiber transmission, respectively. We also engage in detailed modeling to understand the limits of our current experiment and the potential for further improvements. The new protocols we uncover apply the cheap and efficient hardware of CV-QKD systems in a significantly more secure setting.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the third order optical nonlinearity of 51 chalcogenide glasses in the near infrared. Substituting more polarizable elements (Se for S, Sb for As) into the glasses increased their nonlinearity but also reduced the optical bandgap increasing two-photon absorption. Overall the measured values are an extremely good fit to the semi-empirical Miller's rule whilst the normalized real and imaginary parts are in satisfactory agreement with the scaling for indirect gap semiconductors reported by Dinu. At 1550nm we find that there is an upper limit to the nonlinearity of ≈ 10-13 cm2/W above which two-photon absorption becomes significant. {\textcopyright} 2014 Optical Society of America.},

In order to check the viability of these schemes under imperfect operations and noise in the channels, we consider one such scheme in detail and show that under moderate conditions it is still possible to extract viable secure shared keys in this scheme. Although we specifically consider only one type of sequential scheme and three different noise models, our method is fairly general to be applied to other QSS schemes and noise models as well.},

While the most well-known example of this discipline is quantum key distribution (QKD), there exist many other applications such as quantum money, randomness generation, secure two- and multi-party computation and delegated quantum computation. Quantum cryptography also studies the limitations and challenges resulting from quantum adversaries---including the impossibility of quantum bit commitment, the difficulty of quantum rewinding and the definition of quantum security models for classical primitives. In this review article, aimed primarily at cryptographers unfamiliar with the quantum world, we survey the area of theoretical quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on the constructions and limitations beyond the realm of QKD.},

abstract = {Intrapulse quantum spectral correlation of photon numbers of a femtosecond optical pulse, which propagates a 5-m-long optical fiber, is presented in a matrix format for quantum noise study by numerical calculation. The calculation includes the higher-order optical effects such as intrapulse-stimulated Raman scattering and self-steepening effects, as well as self-phase modulation and group velocity dispersion. The quantum correlations between spectral components (spectral resolution of 0.7 nm) which evolve with the pulse energy are provided in a matrix format at soliton orders including the low orders, N=0.1 to 1.0 (a 0.1 step), to give the detailed properties of spectral correlation evolutions in the matrix format. It is shown that the photon-number correlations between spectral components near the pulse spectrum center form strong correlations of a square shape in the matrix, at a soliton order N (≤0.4), and then are redistributed into those between spectral components near the spectrum wings such that the cross-shaped correlation pattern in the matrix begin to be visible at N=0.5 before their further redistribution as N→1.0. In addition, significant anticorrelations can be increasingly extended to be found between spectral components near the spectrum center as N→1.0, leading to the expectation that the degree of photon-number squeezing by spectral filtering for subsolitons can be lower than that for solitons. Intrapulse-stimulated Raman scattering that starts to become visible at around N=0.6 produces an asymmetric correlation structure with respect to the spectrum center in the correlation matrices while the relevant pulse self-frequency shift becomes visible at N0.8. The calculation presented indicates that the measurement of nonlinear effects which are not detectable distinctly at the classical level is possible at the quantum level. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Dissipation, the irreversible loss of energy and coherence, from a microsystem, is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem (or reservoir) which is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of its degrees of freedom. The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing over the reservoir states, resulting in an irreversible decay as excitation leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir environment. Earlier treatments of this dissipation described an ensemble of microsystems using density matrices, either in Schroedinger picture with Master equations, or in Heisenberg picture with Langevin equations. The development of experimental techniques to study single quantum systems (for example single trapped ions, or cavity radiation field modes) has stimulated the construction of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a particular observation record of the decay channel, in the environment. These methods, variously described as Quantum Jump, Monte Carlo Wavefunction and Quantum Trajectory methods are the subject of this review article. We discuss their derivation, apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics and relate them to ensemble descriptions.},

abstract = {Quantum digital signatures can be used to authenticate classical messages in an information-theoretically secure way. Previously, a novel quantum digital signature for classical messages has been proposed and gave an experimental demonstration of distributing quantum digital signatures from one sender to two receivers. Some improvement versions were subsequently presented, which made it more feasible with present technology. These proposals for quantum digital signatures are basic building blocks which only deal with the problem of sending single bit messages while no-forging and non-repudiation are guaranteed. For a multi-bit message, it is only mentioned that the basic building blocks must be iterated, but the iteration of the basic building block still does not suffice to define the entire protocol. In this paper, we show that it is necessary to define the entire protocol because some attacks will arise if these building blocks are used in a naive way of iteration. Therefore, we give a way of defining an entire protocol to deal with the problem of sending multi-bit messages based on the basic building blocks and analyse its security.},

abstract = {Secret sharing allows a trusted party (the dealer) to distribute a secret to a group of players, who can only access the secret cooperatively. Quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols could provide unconditional security based on fundamental laws in physics. While the general security proof has been established recently in an entanglement-based QSS protocol, the tolerable channel loss is unfortunately rather small. Here we propose a continuous variable QSS protocol using conventional laser sources and homodyne detectors. In this protocol, a Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) prepared by one player passes through the secure stations of the other players sequentially, and each of the other players injects a locally prepared, independent GMCS into the circulating optical mode. Finally, the dealer measures both the amplitude and phase quadratures of the receiving optical mode using double homodyne detectors. Collectively, the players can use their encoded random numbers to estimate the measurement results of the dealer and further generate a shared key. Unlike the existing single photon based sequential QSS protocol, our scheme is intrinsically immune to Trojan horse attacks. Furthermore, the additional loss introduced by each player's system can be extremely small, which makes the protocol scalable to a large number of players. We prove the unconditional security of the proposed protocol against both eavesdroppers and dishonest players in the presence of high channel loss, and discuss various practical issues.},

The resulting equations do not show the conventional linear dependence of $\chi$R(3) with n2 and $\chi$I(3) with $\beta$. Nonlinear refraction and absorption result instead from the interplay between the real and imaginary parts of the first- and third-order susceptibilities of the material. This effect is illustrated in the case of a metal–dielectric nanocomposite for which n2 and $\beta$ values were experimentally obtained by Z-scan measurements and for which the use of the new formulas for $\chi$R(3) and $\chi$I(3) yield a large correction and a sign reversal for $\chi$I(3).},

@article{crepeau_approximate_2005,
abstract = {It is a standard result in the theory of quantum error-correcting codes that no code of length n can fix more than n/4 arbitrary errors, regardless of the dimension of the coding and encoded Hilbert spaces. However, this bound only applies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect that correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations of this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors with fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of the registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp distinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes have the property that any {\$}t{\$} components reveal no information about the message, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing schemes. The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and quantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better classical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error correction. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is n/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact and approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the delicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.},

abstract = {A photonic circuit is generally described as a structure in which light propagates by unitary exchange and transfers reversibly between channels. In contrast, the term ‘diffusive' is more akin to a chaotic propagation in scattering media, where light is driven out of coherence towards a thermal mixture. Based on the dynamics of open quantum systems, the combination of these two opposites can result in novel techniques for coherent light control. The crucial feature of these photonic structures is dissipative coupling between modes, via an interaction with a common reservoir. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that such systems can perform optical equalisation to smooth multimode light, or act as a distributor, guiding it into selected channels. Quantum thermodynamically, these systems can act as catalytic coherent reservoirs by performing perfect non-Landauer erasure. For lattice structures, localised stationary states can be supported in the continuum, similar to compacton-like states in conventional flat-band lattices.},
