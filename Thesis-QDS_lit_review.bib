abstract = {We discuss quantum key distribution protocols using quantum continuous variables. We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent to the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the resistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure with high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol, even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in the absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual'' entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.},

@article{Leverrier2017,
abstract = {Establishing the security of continuous-variable quantum key distribution against general attacks in a realistic finite-size regime is an outstanding open problem in the field of theoretical quantum cryptography if we restrict our attention to protocols that rely on the exchange of coherent states. Indeed, techniques based on the uncertainty principle are not known to work for such protocols, and the usual tools based on de Finetti reductions only provide security for unrealistically large block lengths. We address this problem here by considering a new type of Gaussian de Finetti reduction, that exploits the invariance of some continuous-variable protocols under the action of the unitary group {\$}U(n){\$} (instead of the symmetric group {\$}S{\_}n{\$} as in usual de Finetti theorems), and by introducing generalized {\$}SU(2,2){\$} coherent states. Our reduction shows that it is sufficient to prove the security of these protocols against Gaussian collective attacks in order to obtain security against general attacks, thereby confirming rigorously the widely held belief that Gaussian attacks are indeed optimal against such protocols.},

@article{Amiri2015,
abstract = {Signature schemes, proposed in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, have become ubiquitous across modern communications. They allow for the exchange of messages from one sender to multiple recipients, with the guarantees that messages cannot be forged or tampered with and that messages also can be forwarded from one recipient to another without compromising their validity. Signatures are different from, but no less important than encryption, which ensures the privacy of a message. Commonly used signature protocols - signatures based on the Rivest-Adleman-Shamir (RSA) algorithm, the digital signature algorithm (DSA), and the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) - are only computationally secure, similar to public key encryption methods. In fact, since these rely on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithms or factoring large primes, it is known that they will become completely insecure with the emergence of quantum computers. We may therefore see a shift towards signature protocols that will remain secure even in a post-quantum world. Ideally, such schemes would provide unconditional or information-theoretic security. In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible and comprehensive review of existing unconditionally secure signature schemes for signing classical messages, with a focus on unconditionally secure quantum signature schemes.},

@article{Richter2020,
abstract = {Agile cryptography allows for a resource-efficient swap of a cryptographic core in case the security of an underlying classical cryptographic algorithm becomes compromised. In this paper, we suggest how this principle can be applied to the field of quantum cryptography. We explicitly demonstrate two quantum cryptographic protocols: quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform, with protocols only differing in their classical post-processing. The system is also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver, enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are inherently multipartite and we prove that they are secure not only when a player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external) eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In the first proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile quantum communication system, the quantum states were distributed at GHz rates. This allows for a one-bit message to be securely signed using our QDS protocols in less than {\$}0.05{\$}{\~{}}ms over a {\$}2{\$}{\~{}}km fiber link and in less than {\$}0.2{\$}{\~{}}s over a {\$}20{\$}{\~{}}km fiber link. To our knowledge, this also marks the first demonstration of a continuous-variable direct QSS protocol.},

@article{An2019a,
abstract = {Quantum digital signature (QDS) can guarantee message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical security, and it has attracted more attention recently. Since proposed by Andersson et al. [Phys. Rev. A 93, 032325 (2016)], a quantum digital signature protocol using an insecure channel has been realized with several different quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Here we report an experimental QDS based on a BB84 QKD system. An asymmetric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson interferometer structure has been designed in our system, which is intrinsi-cally stable against channel disturbance. The innovatory structure supports the system to work at high speed and, in practice, the repetition rate is in gigahertz. A 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 25 dB channel loss composed of a 25 km installed fiber with additional optical attenuation in a 10 −10 security level. Thus, our QDS device is stable and highly efficient. This Letter provides a further step for the practical application of QDS. The digital signature is an important cryptographic scheme, and it is widely used in modern telecommunication. In digital signature, a message will be signed with the authentication of a legitimate user, which ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeabil-ity, and transferability of the message. Most of the classical digital signature schemes, such as Rivest, Shamir, and Aldeman [1]; digital signature algorithm (DSA) [2]; and elliptic curve DSA [3], depend on the computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers or finding discrete logarithms. The assumptions of computational difficulty will not be valid with the advent of quantum computers. The digital signature schemes which remain secure in the age of quantum computation are urgently needed. In 2001, the first quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme was proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [4]. However, the scheme requires long-time quantum memory, nondestructive state comparison , and a secure quantum channel, which are all impractical in experiment. Then different QDS protocols have been proposed [5-9]. References [10] and [11] reported the QDS experiment without the requirement of nondestructive state comparison and quantum memory, respectively. However, they still require a secure quantum channel. Then Refs. [12,13] realized QDS in kilometer range with the assumption of a secure quantum channel. Recently, the QDS schemes [14,15] which do not require the secure quantum channel have been proposed, and several experiments have been reported based on BB84 [16], differential phase shift (DPS) [17,18], measurement-device-independent (MDI) [19-21] quantum key distribution (QKD) devices. Here we report an experimental QDS based on an asym-metric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson BB84 QKD system [22], which is intrinsically stable against channel disturbance and high-speed support. In addition, the phase-encoding states are used in our scheme. With the consideration of the finite effect, 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 10 −10 security level and 25 dB channel loss. Compared with the previous QDS experiments , our scheme provides a tradeoff among the practical security , high rate and the stabilization of the QDS system. Here we only consider the QDS among three parties. QDS among more parties is possible with the consideration of concluding adversaries [23]. In a three-party scenario, we assume that there is only one party that is dishonest at most. Specifically, our QDS protocol has two stages, a distribution stage and a messaging stage. In the distribution stage, Bob sends a group of weak coherent state pulses (randomly in X or Z Letter Vol. 44, No.},

abstract = {Quantum key distribution using weak coherent states and homodyne detection is a promising candidate for practical quantum-cryptographic implementations due to its compatibility with existing telecom equipment and high detection efficiencies. However, despite the actual simplicity of the protocol, the security analysis of this method is rather involved compared to discrete-variable QKD. In this article we review the theoretical foundations of continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) with Gaussian modulation and rederive the essential relations from scratch in a pedagogical way. The aim of this paper is to be as comprehensive and self-contained as possible in order to be well intelligible even for readers with little pre-knowledge on the subject. Although the present article is a theoretical discussion of CV-QKD, its focus lies on practical implementations, taking into account various kinds of hardware imperfections and suggesting practical methods to perform the security analysis subsequent to the key exchange. Apart from a review of well known results, this manuscript presents a set of new original noise models which are helpful to get an estimate of how well a given set of hardware will perform in practice.},

The signa- ture schemes that are in use today are based on public-key cryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However, it is possible to construct un- conditionally secure signature protocols. In particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature schemes with security based on fundamental princi- ples of quantum mechanics. Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has been explicitly generalised to more than three participants, and their security goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security definitions of Swanson and Stinson [1] so that they can apply also to the quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty signature protocols with information- theoretic security – quantum or classical – must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature pro- tocol given in [2] to the multiparty case, proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability. Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point- to-point quantum key distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.},

Here, security against forging relies on the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing between nonorthogonal quantum states. A serious drawback of previous quantum digital signature schemes is that they require long-term quantum memory, making them impractical at present. We present the first realization of a scheme that does not need quantum memory and which also uses only standard linear optical components and photodetectors.

Exploiting the decoy state modulation, we have successfully signed one bit message through up to 102 km optical fiber. Furthermore, we continuously run the system to sign the longer message "USTC" with 32 bit at the distance of 51 km. Our results pave the way towards the practical application of QDS.},

abstract = {Digital signatures are frequently used in data transfer to prevent impersonation, repudiation and message tampering. Currently used classical digital signature schemes rely on public key encryption techniques, where the complexity of so-called 'one-way' mathematical functions is used to provide security over sufficiently long timescales. No mathematical proofs are known for the long-term security of such techniques. Quantum digital signatures offer a means of sending a message, which cannot be forged or repudiated, with security verified by information-theoretical limits and quantum mechanics. Here we demonstrate an experimental system, which distributes quantum signatures from one sender to two receivers and enables message sending ensured against forging and repudiation. Additionally, we analyse the security of the system in some typical scenarios. Our system is based on the interference of phase-encoded coherent states of light and our implementation utilizes polarization-maintaining optical fibre and photons with a wavelength of 850 nm.},

Currently used "classical" signature schemes rely on unproven computational assumptions for security, while quantum signatures rely only on the laws of quantum mechanics. Previous quantum signature schemes have used unambiguous quantum measurements. Such measurements, however, sometimes give no result, reducing the efficiency of the protocol. Here, we instead use heterodyne detection, which always gives a result, although there is always some uncertainty. We experimentally demonstrate feasibility in a real environment by distributing signature states through a noisy 1.6km free-space channel. Our results show that continuous-variable heterodyne detection improves the signature rate for this type of scheme and therefore represents an interesting direction in the search for practical quantum signature schemes.},

abstract = {Quantum digital signature (QDS) can guarantee message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical security, and it has attracted more attention recently. Since proposed by Andersson et al. [Phys. Rev. A 93, 032325 (2016)], a quantum digital signature protocol using an insecure channel has been realized with several different quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Here we report an experimental QDS based on a BB84 QKD system. An asymmetric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson interferometer structure has been designed in our system, which is intrinsi-cally stable against channel disturbance. The innovatory structure supports the system to work at high speed and, in practice, the repetition rate is in gigahertz. A 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 25 dB channel loss composed of a 25 km installed fiber with additional optical attenuation in a 10 −10 security level. Thus, our QDS device is stable and highly efficient. This Letter provides a further step for the practical application of QDS. The digital signature is an important cryptographic scheme, and it is widely used in modern telecommunication. In digital signature, a message will be signed with the authentication of a legitimate user, which ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeabil-ity, and transferability of the message. Most of the classical digital signature schemes, such as Rivest, Shamir, and Aldeman [1]; digital signature algorithm (DSA) [2]; and elliptic curve DSA [3], depend on the computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers or finding discrete logarithms. The assumptions of computational difficulty will not be valid with the advent of quantum computers. The digital signature schemes which remain secure in the age of quantum computation are urgently needed. In 2001, the first quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme was proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [4]. However, the scheme requires long-time quantum memory, nondestructive state comparison , and a secure quantum channel, which are all impractical in experiment. Then different QDS protocols have been proposed [5-9]. References [10] and [11] reported the QDS experiment without the requirement of nondestructive state comparison and quantum memory, respectively. However, they still require a secure quantum channel. Then Refs. [12,13] realized QDS in kilometer range with the assumption of a secure quantum channel. Recently, the QDS schemes [14,15] which do not require the secure quantum channel have been proposed, and several experiments have been reported based on BB84 [16], differential phase shift (DPS) [17,18], measurement-device-independent (MDI) [19-21] quantum key distribution (QKD) devices. Here we report an experimental QDS based on an asym-metric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson BB84 QKD system [22], which is intrinsically stable against channel disturbance and high-speed support. In addition, the phase-encoding states are used in our scheme. With the consideration of the finite effect, 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 10 −10 security level and 25 dB channel loss. Compared with the previous QDS experiments , our scheme provides a tradeoff among the practical security , high rate and the stabilization of the QDS system. Here we only consider the QDS among three parties. QDS among more parties is possible with the consideration of concluding adversaries [23]. In a three-party scenario, we assume that there is only one party that is dishonest at most. Specifically, our QDS protocol has two stages, a distribution stage and a messaging stage. In the distribution stage, Bob sends a group of weak coherent state pulses (randomly in X or Z Letter Vol. 44, No.},

These proposals for quantum digital signatures are basic building blocks which only deal with the problem of sending single bit messages while no-forging and non-repudiation are guaranteed. For a multi-bit message, it is only mentioned that the basic building blocks must be iterated, but the iteration of the basic building block still does not suffice to define the entire protocol. In this paper, we show that it is necessary to define the entire protocol because some attacks will arise if these building blocks are used in a naive way of iteration.

Our continuous-variable (CV) scheme relies on phase measurement of a distributed alphabet of coherent states, and allows for secure message authentication against a quantum adversary performing collective beamsplitter and entangling-cloner attacks. Crucially, for the first time in the CV setting we allow for an eavesdropper on the quantum channels and yet retain shorter signature lengths than previous protocols with no eavesdropper.

abstract = {Digital signatures are widely used in electronic communications to secure important tasks such as financial transactions, software updates, and legal contracts. The signature schemes that are in use today are based on public-key cryptography and derive their security from computational assumptions. However, it is possible to construct unconditionally secure signature protocols. In particular, using quantum communication, it is possible to construct signature schemes with security based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Several quantum signature protocols have been proposed, but none of them has been explicitly generalized to more than three participants, and their security goals have not been formally defined. Here, we first extend the security definitions of Swanson and Stinson (2011) so that they can apply also to the quantum case, and introduce a formal definition of transferability based on different verification levels. We then prove several properties that multiparty signature protocols with information-theoretic security -- quantum or classical -- must satisfy in order to achieve their security goals. We also express two existing quantum signature protocols with three parties in the security framework we have introduced. Finally, we generalize a quantum signature protocol given in Wallden-Dunjko-Kent-Andersson (2015) to the multiparty case, proving its security against forging, repudiation and non-transferability. Notably, this protocol can be implemented using any point-to-point quantum key distribution network and therefore is ready to be experimentally demonstrated.},

abstract = {Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) protocols with discrete modulation are interesting due to their experimental simplicity, but their security analysis is less advanced than that of Gaussian modulation schemes. We analyze the security of two variants of CV-QKD protocol with quaternary modulation against collective attacks in the asymptotic limit. Our security analysis is based on the numerical optimization of the asymptotic key rate formula with a photon number cutoff assumption that truncates the dimension of the system. When the cutoff photon number is chosen to be sufficiently large, our results do not depend on the specific choice of cutoff. Our analysis shows that this protocol can achieve much higher key rates over long distances compared with binary and ternary modulation schemes and yield key rates comparable to Gaussian modulation schemes. Furthermore, our security analysis method allows us to evaluate variations of the discrete-modulated protocols, including direct and reverse reconciliation, and also postselection strategies. We also demonstrate that postselection in combination with reverse reconciliation can improve the key rates.},

abstract = {Guaranteeing non-repudiation and unforgeability as well as transferability of a signatory is one of the most vital safeguards in today's e-commerce era. Based on fundamental laws of quantum physics, quantum digital signature (QDS) aims to provide information-theoretical security for digital signature widely used nowadays. However, up to date, the previously proposed QDS schemes are impractical due to various challenging problems and most importantly, the requirement of authenticated quantum channels between participants. Here, for the first time, we eliminate all existing problems by proposing a practical and surprisingly simple QDS protocol, whose unconditional security is proven. Our QDS scheme can be implemented over a distance of more than 100 km under technology comparable to quantum key distribution. QDS is an important compliment to quantum key distribution and provides unconditionally secure protection to applications requiring digital signature.},

Quantum cryptography also studies the limitations and challenges resulting from quantum adversaries---including the impossibility of quantum bit commitment, the difficulty of quantum rewinding and the definition of quantum security models for classical primitives. In this review article, aimed primarily at cryptographers unfamiliar with the quantum world, we survey the area of theoretical quantum cryptography, with an emphasis on the constructions and limitations beyond the realm of QKD.},

Combining our proof with either the de Finetti theorem or the postselection technique then shows the security of the protocol against general attacks, thereby confirming the long-standing conjecture that Gaussian attacks are optimal asymptotically in the composable security framework.

abstract = {We present a quantum digital signature scheme whose security is based on fundamental principles of quantum physics. It allows a sender (Alice) to sign a message in such a way that the signature can be validated by a number of different people, and all will agree either that the message came from Alice or that it has been tampered with. To accomplish this task, each recipient of the message must have a copy of Alice's "public key," which is a set of quantum states whose exact identity is known only to Alice. Quantum public keys are more difficult to deal with than classical public keys: for instance, only a limited number of copies can be in circulation, or the scheme becomes insecure. However, in exchange for this price, we achieve unconditionally secure digital signatures. Sending an m-bit message uses up O(m) quantum bits for each recipient of the public key. We briefly discuss how to securely distribute quantum public keys, and show the signature scheme is absolutely secure using one method of key distribution. The protocol provides a model for importing the ideas of classical public key cryptography into the quantum world.},

Currently used classical digital signature schemes, however, only offer security relying on unproven computational assumptions. In contrast, quantum digital signatures offer information-theoretic security based on laws of quantum mechanics. Here, security against forging relies on the impossibility of perfectly distinguishing between nonorthogonal quantum states. A serious drawback of previous quantum digital signature schemes is that they require long-term quantum memory, making them impractical at present.We present the first realization of a scheme that does not need quantum memory and which also uses only standard linear optical components and photodetectors.
