abstract = {Integrated single photon sources are key building blocks for realizing scalable devices for quantum information processing. For such applications highly coherent and indistinguishable single photons on a chip are required. Here we report on a triggered resonance fluorescence single photon source based on In(Ga)As/GaAs quantum dots coupled to single-and multimode ridge waveguides. We demonstrate the generation of highly linearly polarized resonance fluorescence photons with 99.1{\%} (96.0{\%}) single photon purity and 97.5{\%} (95.0{\%}) indistinguishability in case of multimode (single mode) waveguide devices fulfilling the strict requirements imposed by multi-interferometric quantum optics applications. Our integrated triggered single photon source can be readily scaled up, promising a realistic pathway for on-chip linear optical quantum simulation, quantum computation, and quantum networks.},

@article{Arnon-Friedman2018,
abstract = {Device-independent cryptography goes beyond conventional quantum cryptography by providing security that holds independently of the quality of the underlying physical devices. Device-independent protocols are based on the quantum phenomena of non-locality and the violation of Bell inequalities. This high level of security could so far only be established under conditions which are not achievable experimentally. Here we present a property of entropy, termed “entropy accumulation”, which asserts that the total amount of entropy of a large system is the sum of its parts. We use this property to prove the security of cryptographic protocols, including device-independent quantum key distribution, while achieving essentially optimal parameters. Recent experimental progress, which enabled loophole-free Bell tests, suggests that the achieved parameters are technologically accessible. Our work hence pro- vides the theoretical groundwork for experimental demonstrations of device-independent cryptography.},

abstract = {Semi-quantum protocols that allow some of the users to remain classical are proposed for a large class of problems associated with secure communication and secure multiparty computation. Specifically, first time semi-quantum protocols are proposed for key agreement, controlled deterministic secure communication and dialogue, and it is shown that the semi-quantum protocols for controlled deterministic secure communication and dialogue can be reduced to semi-quantum protocols for e-commerce and private comparison (socialist millionaire problem), respectively. Complementing with the earlier proposed semi-quantum schemes for key distribution, secret sharing and deterministic secure communication, set of schemes proposed here and subsequent discussions have established that almost every secure communication and computation tasks that can be performed using fully quantum protocols can also be performed in semi-quantum manner. Further, it addresses a fundamental question in context of a large number problems- how much quantumness is (how many quantum parties are) required to perform a specific secure communication task? Some of the proposed schemes are completely orthogonal-state-based, and thus, fundamentally different from the existing semi-quantum schemes that are conjugate-coding-based. Security, efficiency and applicability of the proposed schemes have been discussed with appropriate importance.},

abstract = {It is a standard result in the theory of quantum error-correcting codes that no code of length n can fix more than n/4 arbitrary errors, regardless of the dimension of the coding and encoded Hilbert spaces. However, this bound only applies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect that correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations of this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors with fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of the registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp distinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes have the property that any {\$}t{\$} components reveal no information about the message, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing schemes. The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and quantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better classical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error correction. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is n/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact and approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the delicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.},

abstract = {Conventional strategies of quantum metrology are built upon POVMs, thereby possessing several general features, including the demolition of the state to be measured, the need of performing a number of measurements, and the degradation of performance under decoherence and dissipation. Here, we propose an innovative measurement scheme, called dissipative adiabatic measurements (DAMs), based on which, we further develop an approach to estimation of parameters characterizing dissipative processes. Unlike a POVM, whose outcome is one of the eigenvalues of an observable, a DAM yields the expectation value of the observable as its outcome, without collapsing the state to be measured. By virtue of the very nature of DAMs, our approach is capable of solving the estimation problem in a state-protective fashion with only {\$}M{\$} measurements, where {\$}M{\$} is the number of parameters to be estimated. More importantly, contrary to the common wisdom, it embraces decoherence and dissipation as beneficial effects and offers a Heisenberg-like scaling of precision, thus outperforming conventional strategies. Our DAM-based approach is direct, efficient, and expected to be immensely useful in the context of dissipative quantum information processing.},

abstract = {The shot-noise unit in continuous-variable quantum key distribution plays an important and fundamental role in experimental implementation as it is used as a normalization parameter that contribute to perform security analysis and distill the key information. However, the traditional calibration procedure and detector model can not cover all system noise in practical application, which will result in some loopholes and influence the practical security. What's more, the traditional procedure is also rather complicated and has difficulty in compatible with automatic operating system. In this paper we propose a calibration model based on the proposed trusted detector model, which could naturally close the loopholes in practical application. It can help identify the shot-noise unit in only one step, which can not only effectively simplify the evaluation process but also reduce the statistical fluctuation, while two steps are needed in traditional method. We prove its feasibility and derive the complete version of the corresponding entanglement-based model. Detailed security analysis against arbitrary collective attacks and numerous simulation results in both the asymptotic limit regime and the finite-size regime are provided. A proof-of-principle experiment has been implemented and the results indicate that the one-time-calibration model can be employed as a powerful substitution to calibrate the shot-noise unit. Our method paves the way for the deployment of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with real time calibration and automatic operation.},

@article{An2019a,
abstract = {Quantum digital signature (QDS) can guarantee message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical security, and it has attracted more attention recently. Since proposed by Andersson et al. [Phys. Rev. A 93, 032325 (2016)], a quantum digital signature protocol using an insecure channel has been realized with several different quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Here we report an experimental QDS based on a BB84 QKD system. An asymmetric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson interferometer structure has been designed in our system, which is intrinsi-cally stable against channel disturbance. The innovatory structure supports the system to work at high speed and, in practice, the repetition rate is in gigahertz. A 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 25 dB channel loss composed of a 25 km installed fiber with additional optical attenuation in a 10 −10 security level. Thus, our QDS device is stable and highly efficient. This Letter provides a further step for the practical application of QDS. The digital signature is an important cryptographic scheme, and it is widely used in modern telecommunication. In digital signature, a message will be signed with the authentication of a legitimate user, which ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeabil-ity, and transferability of the message. Most of the classical digital signature schemes, such as Rivest, Shamir, and Aldeman [1]; digital signature algorithm (DSA) [2]; and elliptic curve DSA [3], depend on the computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers or finding discrete logarithms. The assumptions of computational difficulty will not be valid with the advent of quantum computers. The digital signature schemes which remain secure in the age of quantum computation are urgently needed. In 2001, the first quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme was proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [4]. However, the scheme requires long-time quantum memory, nondestructive state comparison , and a secure quantum channel, which are all impractical in experiment. Then different QDS protocols have been proposed [5-9]. References [10] and [11] reported the QDS experiment without the requirement of nondestructive state comparison and quantum memory, respectively. However, they still require a secure quantum channel. Then Refs. [12,13] realized QDS in kilometer range with the assumption of a secure quantum channel. Recently, the QDS schemes [14,15] which do not require the secure quantum channel have been proposed, and several experiments have been reported based on BB84 [16], differential phase shift (DPS) [17,18], measurement-device-independent (MDI) [19-21] quantum key distribution (QKD) devices. Here we report an experimental QDS based on an asym-metric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson BB84 QKD system [22], which is intrinsically stable against channel disturbance and high-speed support. In addition, the phase-encoding states are used in our scheme. With the consideration of the finite effect, 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 10 −10 security level and 25 dB channel loss. Compared with the previous QDS experiments , our scheme provides a tradeoff among the practical security , high rate and the stabilization of the QDS system. Here we only consider the QDS among three parties. QDS among more parties is possible with the consideration of concluding adversaries [23]. In a three-party scenario, we assume that there is only one party that is dishonest at most. Specifically, our QDS protocol has two stages, a distribution stage and a messaging stage. In the distribution stage, Bob sends a group of weak coherent state pulses (randomly in X or Z Letter Vol. 44, No.},

Here, we propose a simple solution to this problem-measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (QKD). It not only removes all detector side channels, but also doubles the secure distance with conventional lasers. Our proposal can be implemented with standard optical components with low detection efficiency and highly lossy channels. In contrast to the previous solution of full device independent QKD, the realization of our idea does not require detectors of near unity detection efficiency in combination with a qubit amplifier (based on teleportation) or a quantum nondemolition measurement of the number of photons in a pulse. Furthermore, its key generation rate is many orders of magnitude higher than that based on full device independent QKD. The results show that long-distance quantum cryptography over say 200km will remain secure even with seriously flawed detectors. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {This chapter is devoted to the nonlinear effects occurring in four types of fiber interferometers. Four common fiber interferometers are the fiber versions of the well-known Fabry–Perot, Mach–Zehnder, Sagnac, and Michelson interferometers. They exhibit interesting nonlinear effects that are useful for optical-switching applications, when power levels are large enough for the nonlinear phenomenon of self–phase modulation (SPM) or cross-phase modulation (XPM) to become important. There are two fiber components covered that can be combined to form a variety of fiber-based optical devices. Fabry–Perot and ring resonators are well-known devices used commonly for making lasers. A fiber-based Fabry–Perot resonator can be constructed by simply making two ends of an optical fiber partially reflecting. This can be realized in practice by using external mirrors or by depositing high-reflectivity coatings at the two ends. This chapter explores the theory of modulation instability, including the effects of feedback occurring inside a fiber resonator. The analysis is quite involved in the case of a Fabry–Perot cavity since one must use the coupled NLS equations describing the evolution of the forward- and backward-propagating waves. By exploiting different nonlinear effects such as XPM, SPM, and four-wave mixing (FWM) occurring inside the fiber used to make the Sagnac loop, one can employ a nonlinear fiber-loop mirror for many practical applications.},

abstract = {Quantum digital signatures (QDSs) apply quantum mechanics to the problem of guaranteeing message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical security, which are complementary to the confidentiality realized by quantum key distribution (QKD). Previous experimental demonstrations have been limited to transmission distances of less than 5 km of optical fiber in a laboratory setting. Here we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of QDSs over installed optical fiber, as well as the longest transmission link reported to date. This demonstration used a 90 km long differential phase shift QKD to achieve approximately one signed bit per second, an increase in the signature generation rate of several orders of magnitude over previous optical fiber demonstrations.},

abstract = {Expressions relating complex third-order optical susceptibility ($\chi$(3)=$\chi$R(3)+i$\chi$I(3)) with nonlinear refractive index (n2) and nonlinear absorption coefficient ($\beta$) have been formulated that eliminate the commonly used approximation of a negligible linear absorption coefficient. The resulting equations do not show the conventional linear dependence of $\chi$R(3) with n2 and $\chi$I(3) with $\beta$. Nonlinear refraction and absorption result instead from the interplay between the real and imaginary parts of the first- and third-order susceptibilities of the material. This effect is illustrated in the case of a metal–dielectric nanocomposite for which n2 and $\beta$ values were experimentally obtained by Z-scan measurements and for which the use of the new formulas for $\chi$R(3) and $\chi$I(3) yield a large correction and a sign reversal for $\chi$I(3).},

abstract = {In the standard model of quantum secret sharing, typically, one is interested in minimal authorized sets for the reconstruction of the secret. In such a setting, reconstruction requires the communication of all the shares of the corresponding authorized set. If we allow for non-minimal authorized sets, then we can trade off the size of the authorized sets with the amount of communication required for reconstruction. Based on the staircase codes, proposed by Bitar and El Rouayheb, we propose a class of quantum threshold secret sharing schemes that are also communication efficient. We call them {\$}((k,2k-1,d)){\$} communication efficient quantum secret sharing schemes where {\$}k{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}leq d{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}leq2k-1{\$}. Using the proposed construction, we can recover a secret of {\$}d-k+1{\$} qudits by communicating {\$}d{\$} qudits whereas using the standard {\$}((k,2k-1)){\$} quantum secret sharing requires {\$}k(d-k+1){\$} qudits to be communicated. In other words, to share a secret of one qudit, the standard quantum secret sharing requires {\$}k{\$} qudits whereas the proposed schemes communicate only $\backslash${\$}{\{}\backslashtextbackslash{\}}frac{\{}d{\}}{\{}d-k+1{\}}{\$} qudits per qudit in the communication complexity. Proposed schemes can reduce communication overheads by a factor {\$}O(k){\$} with respect to standard schemes, when {\$}d{\$} equals {\$}2k-1{\$}. Further, we show that our schemes have optimal communication cost for secret reconstruction.},

@article{Landsman2019,
abstract = {Quantum theory and functional analysis were created and put into essentially their final form during similar periods ending around 1930. Each was also a key outcome of the major revolutions that both physics and mathematics as a whole underwent at the time. This paper studies their interaction in this light, emphasizing the leading roles played by Hilbert in preparing the ground and by von Neumann in bringing them together during the crucial year of 1927, when he gave the modern, abstract definition of a Hilbert space and applied this concept to quantum mechanics (consolidated in his famous monograph from 1932). Subsequently, I give a very brief overview of three areas of functional analysis that have had fruitful interactions with quantum theory since 1932, namely unbounded operators, operator algebras, and distributions. The paper closes with some musings about the role of functional analysis in actual physics.},

abstract = {Quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes without entanglement have huge advantages in scalability and are easier to realize as they only require sequential communications of a single quantum system. However, these schemes often come with drawbacks such as exact (n; n) structure, flaws in security and in lack of effective cheating detection, which need urgent optimizations. To address this, we propose a verifiable framework of utilizing entanglement-free states to construct (t; n)-QSS schemes. Our work is the first step towards perfect security in entanglement-free QSS, and it sheds light on how to establish effective verification mechanism against cheating. As a result, the proposed framework has a significant importance in constructing QSS schemes for versatile applications in quantum networks due to its intrinsic scalability, flexibility and perfect security.},

It enables the ({\$}t{\$}, {\$}n{\$}) threshold structure based on Shamir's secret sharing and simply requires sequential communication in the {\$}d{\$}-level quantum system to recover secret. Besides, the scheme employs an additional qudit to detect cheats and eavesdropping during secret reconstruction, and allows a participant to use the share repeatedly. Analyses show that the proposed scheme is resistant to typical attacks. The scheme is scalable in the number of participants and easier to realize compared to related schemes. More generally, our scheme also presents a generic method to construct new ({\$}t{\$}, {\$}n{\$}) threshold QSS schemes based on {\$}d{\$}-level quantum system with other classical threshold secret sharing.},

abstract = {We describe a new simple and easy technique called the "Hook and roll technique" (HRT) that uses an articulating hook cautery to provide a critical view during single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC). A 2-cm incision is made at the umbilicus to insert three 5-mm trocars or a multichannel port. After dissection of the serosa of the dorsal and ventral sides of the gall bladder, including Calot's triangle, the angled tip of the hook cautery is inserted between the cystic artery and duct with its tip placed dorsally. The tip is then rotated in a clockwise manner to avoid bile duct injury, allowing the connective tissue between them to be hooked, coagulated and cut. This procedure is repeated several times, followed by dissection between the cystic artery and the liver bed to achieve a critical view. From December 2008 to May 2011, 121 patients underwent SILC using HRT in our hospital without any serious complications. This technique is suitable for SILC, as it is consists of simple procedures that can be performed safely and easily, even by left hand in a cross-over approach, and it allows complete dissection of Calot's triangle to achieve a critical view without using any dissector under dangerous in-line viewing.},

The waveguides, which are designed to exhibit anomalous group-velocity dispersion at wavelengths near 1555 nm, allow phase matched FWM and thus efficient pair-wise generation of non-degenerate signal and idler photons. Photon counting measurements yield a coincidence-to-accidental ratio (CAR) of around 25 for a signal (idler) photon production rate of about 0.05 per pulse. We characterize the variation in CAR as a function of pump power and pump-to-sideband wavelength detuning. These measurements represent a first step towards the development of tools for quantum information processing which are based on CMOS-compatible, silicon-on-insulator technology.},

abstract = {We have demonstrated a metropolitan all-pass quantum communication network in field fiber for four nodes. Any two nodes of them can be connected in the network to perform quantum key distribution (QKD). An optical switching module is presented that enables arbitrary 2-connectivity among output ports. Integrated QKD terminals are worked out, which can operate either as a transmitter, a receiver, or even both at the same time. Furthermore, an additional link in another city of 60 km fiber (up to 130 km) is seamless integrated into this network based on a trusted relay architecture. On all the links, we have implemented protocol of decoy state scheme. All of necessary electrical hardware, synchronization, feedback control, network software, execution of QKD protocols are made by tailored designing, which allow a completely automatical and stable running. Our system has been put into operation in Hefei in August 2009, and publicly demonstrated during an evaluation conference on quantum network organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences on August 29, 2009. Real-time voice telephone with one-time pad encoding between any two of the five nodes (four all-pass nodes plus one additional node through relay) is successfully established in the network within 60km.},

@article{An2019b,
abstract = {Quantum digital signature (QDS) can guarantee message integrity and non-repudiation with information-theoretical security, and it has attracted more attention recently. Since proposed by Andersson et al. [Phys. Rev. A 93, 032325 (2016)], a quantum digital signature protocol using an insecure channel has been realized with several different quantum key distribution (QKD) systems. Here we report an experimental QDS based on a BB84 QKD system. An asymmetric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson interferometer structure has been designed in our system, which is intrinsi-cally stable against channel disturbance. The innovatory structure supports the system to work at high speed and, in practice, the repetition rate is in gigahertz. A 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 25 dB channel loss composed of a 25 km installed fiber with additional optical attenuation in a 10 −10 security level. Thus, our QDS device is stable and highly efficient. This Letter provides a further step for the practical application of QDS. The digital signature is an important cryptographic scheme, and it is widely used in modern telecommunication. In digital signature, a message will be signed with the authentication of a legitimate user, which ensures the nonrepudiation, unforgeabil-ity, and transferability of the message. Most of the classical digital signature schemes, such as Rivest, Shamir, and Aldeman [1]; digital signature algorithm (DSA) [2]; and elliptic curve DSA [3], depend on the computational difficulty of factorizing large numbers or finding discrete logarithms. The assumptions of computational difficulty will not be valid with the advent of quantum computers. The digital signature schemes which remain secure in the age of quantum computation are urgently needed. In 2001, the first quantum digital signature (QDS) scheme was proposed by Gottesman and Chuang [4]. However, the scheme requires long-time quantum memory, nondestructive state comparison , and a secure quantum channel, which are all impractical in experiment. Then different QDS protocols have been proposed [5-9]. References [10] and [11] reported the QDS experiment without the requirement of nondestructive state comparison and quantum memory, respectively. However, they still require a secure quantum channel. Then Refs. [12,13] realized QDS in kilometer range with the assumption of a secure quantum channel. Recently, the QDS schemes [14,15] which do not require the secure quantum channel have been proposed, and several experiments have been reported based on BB84 [16], differential phase shift (DPS) [17,18], measurement-device-independent (MDI) [19-21] quantum key distribution (QKD) devices. Here we report an experimental QDS based on an asym-metric Faraday-Sagnac-Michelson BB84 QKD system [22], which is intrinsically stable against channel disturbance and high-speed support. In addition, the phase-encoding states are used in our scheme. With the consideration of the finite effect, 0.044 bit/s signature rate has been attained with a 10 −10 security level and 25 dB channel loss. Compared with the previous QDS experiments , our scheme provides a tradeoff among the practical security , high rate and the stabilization of the QDS system. Here we only consider the QDS among three parties. QDS among more parties is possible with the consideration of concluding adversaries [23]. In a three-party scenario, we assume that there is only one party that is dishonest at most. Specifically, our QDS protocol has two stages, a distribution stage and a messaging stage. In the distribution stage, Bob sends a group of weak coherent state pulses (randomly in X or Z Letter Vol. 44, No.},

abstract = {In experimentally realistic situations, quantum systems are never perfectly isolated and the coupling to their environment needs to be taken into account. Often, the effect of the environment can be well approximated by a Markovian master equation. However, solving this master equation for quantum many-body systems becomes exceedingly hard due to the high dimension of the Hilbert space. Here we present an approach to the effective simulation of the dynamics of open quantum many-body systems based on machine-learning techniques. We represent the mixed many-body quantum states with neural networks in the form of restricted Boltzmann machines and derive a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for their time evolution and stationary states. We document the accuracy of the approach with numerical examples for a dissipative spin lattice system.},

abstract = {The topic of information theoretic security is introduced and the principal results in this area are reviewed. The basic wire-tap channel model is considered first, and then several specific types of wire-tap channels are considered, including Gaussian, multi-input multi-output (MIMO), compound, and feedback wire-tap channels, as well as the wire-tap channel with side information. Practical code design techniques to achieve secrecy for wire-tap channels are also introduced. The wire-tap formalism is then extended to the basic channels of multi-user networks, including broadcast channels, multiple-access channels (MACs), interference channels, relay channels and two-way channels. For all of these models, results on the fundamental communication limits under secrecy constraints and corresponding coding schemes are reviewed. Furthermore, several related topics including key agreement through common randomness, secure network coding, authentication, cross-layer design, and secure source coding are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Y.

abstract = {We investigate the concept of quantum secret sharing. In a ((k,n)) threshold scheme, a secret quantum state is divided into n shares such that any k of those shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but any set of k-1 or fewer shares contains absolutely no information about the secret. We show that the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum "no-cloning theorem", which requires that n {\textless} 2k, and, in all such cases, we give an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) threshold scheme. We also explore similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k {\textless}= n {\textless} 2k-1 then any ((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state.},

@article{Ozawa2019,
abstract = {Topological photonics is a rapidly emerging field of research in which geometrical and topological ideas are exploited to design and control the behavior of light. Drawing inspiration from the discovery of the quantum Hall effects and topological insulators in condensed matter, recent advances have shown how to engineer analogous effects also for photons, leading to remarkable phenomena such as the robust unidirectional propagation of light, which hold great promise for applications. Thanks to the flexibility and diversity of photonics systems, this field is also opening up new opportunities to realize exotic topological models and to probe and exploit topological effects in new ways. This article reviews experimental and theoretical developments in topological photonics across a wide range of experimental platforms, including photonic crystals, waveguides, metamaterials, cavities, optomechanics, silicon photonics, and circuit QED. A discussion of how changing the dimensionality and symmetries of photonics systems has allowed for the realization of different topological phases is offered, and progress in understanding the interplay of topology with non-Hermitian effects, such as dissipation, is reviewed. As an exciting perspective, topological photonics can be combined with optical nonlinearities, leading toward new collective phenomena and novel strongly correlated states of light, such as an analog of the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

The security of quantum protocols for the task is guaranteed by the fact that Eve's any strategies to obtain secret information from encoded quantum states should cause a disturbance in the signal. Here, we propose a quantum secret sharing (classical information) scheme for {\$}N{\$} parties based on totally different principle in which monitoring signal disturbance is no longer need. In this scheme, the secret is divided among several partners by sequential transmissions of a {\$}L{\$}-dimensional qudit state, which can be practically implemented using a conventional laser and some standard off-the-shelf components. Our scheme paves a novel and practical way for quantum secret sharing.},

abstract = {Universality is an important feature, but less researched in quantum communication protocols. In this paper, a kind of universal quantum secret sharing protocol is investigated. Firstly, we design a quantum secret sharing protocol based on the Borras-Plastino-Batle (BPB) state. Departing from previous research, our protocol has a salient feature in that participants in our protocol only need projective measurement instead of any unitary operations. It makes our protocol more flexible. Secondly, universality of quantum communication protocols is studied for the first time. More specifically, module division of quantum communication protocols and coupling between different modules are discussed. Our aforementioned protocol is analyzed as an example. On one hand, plenty of quantum states (the BPB-class states and the BPB-like-class states, which are proposed in this paper) could be used as carrier to perform our protocol. On the other hand, our protocol also could be regarded as a quantum private comparison protocol with a little revision. These features are rare for quantum communication protocols, and make our protocol more robust. Thirdly, entanglements of the BPB-class states are calculated in the Appendix.},

The ideal single-photon source is an on-demand, deterministic, single-photon source delivering light pulses in a well-defined polarization and spatiotemporal mode, and containing exactly one photon. In addition, for many applications, there is a quantum advantage if the single photons are indistinguishable in all their degrees of freedom. Single-photon sources based on parametric down-conversion are currently used, and while excellent in many ways, scaling to large quantum optical systems remains challenging. In 2000, semiconductor quantum dots were shown to emit single photons, opening a path towards integrated single-photon sources. Here, we review the progress achieved in the past few years, and discuss remaining challenges. The latest quantum dot-based single-photon sources are edging closer to the ideal single-photon source, and have opened new possibilities for quantum technologies.},

abstract = {In recent years it was recognized that properties of physical systems such as entanglement, athermality, and asymmetry, can be viewed as resources for important tasks in quantum information, thermodynamics, and other areas of physics. This recognition followed by the development of specific quantum resource theories (QRTs), such as entanglement theory, determining how quantum states that cannot be prepared under certain restrictions may be manipulated and used to circumvent the restrictions. Here we discuss the general structure of QRTs, and show that under a few assumptions (such as convexity of the set of free states), a QRT is asymptotically reversible if its set of allowed operations is maximal; that is, if the allowed operations are the set of all operations that do not generate (asymptotically) a resource. In this case, the asymptotic conversion rate is given in terms of the regularized relative entropy of a resource which is the unique measure/quantifier of the resource in the asymptotic limit of many copies of the state. This measure also equals the smoothed version of the logarithmic robustness of the resource.},

abstract = {Quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes without entanglement have huge advantages in scalability and are easier to realize as they only require sequential communications of a single quantum system. However, these schemes often come with drawbacks such as exact (n, n) structure, security flaws and absences of effective cheating detections. To address these problems, we propose a verifiable framework by utilizing entanglement-free states to construct (t, n)-QSS schemes. Our work is the heuristic step toward information-theoretical security in entanglement-free QSS, and it sheds light on how to establish effective verification mechanism against cheating. As a result, the proposed framework has a significant importance in constructing QSS schemes for versatile applications in quantum networks due to its intrinsic scalability, flexibility and information-theoretical security.},

abstract = {Suppose that Alice and Bob are located in distant laboratories, which are connected by an ideal quantum channel. Suppose further that they share many copies of a quantum state $\rho$ABE, such that Alice possesses the A systems and Bob the BE systems. In our model, there is an identifiable part of Bob's laboratory that is insecure: a third party named Eve has infiltrated Bob's laboratory and gained control of the E systems. Alice, knowing this, would like use their shared state and the ideal quantum channel to communicate a message in such a way that Bob, who has access to the whole of his laboratory (BE systems), can decode it, while Eve, who has access only to a sector of Bob's laboratory (E systems) and the ideal quantum channel connecting Alice to Bob, cannot learn anything about Alice's transmitted message. We call this task the conditional one-time pad, and in this paper, we prove that the optimal rate of secret communication for this task is equal to the conditional quantum mutual information I(A; B|E) of their shared state. We thus give the conditional quantum mutual information an operational meaning that is different from those given in prior works, via state redistribution, conditional erasure, or state deconstruction. We also generalize the model and method in several ways, one of which demonstrates that the negative tripartite interaction information −I3(A; B; E) ≡ I(A; BE) − I(A; B) − I(A; E) of a tripartite state $\rho$ABE is an achievable rate for a secret-sharing task, i.e., the case in which Alice's message should be secure from someone possessing only the AB or AE systems but should be decodable by someone possessing all systems A, B, and E. Introduction—The main purpose of this paper is to show that the optimal rate of a communication task, which we call the conditional one-time pad, is equal to a fundamental information quantity called the conditional quantum mutual information. To prove this statement, we operate in the regime of quantum Shannon theory, and we suppose that Alice and Bob possess a large num-ber n of copies of a quantum state $\rho$ ABE . We suppose that one party Alice has access to all of the A systems, and another party Bob has access to all of the BE sys-tems. We suppose that Bob's laboratory is divided into two parts, one of which is secure (the B part) and the other which is insecure (the E part) and accessible to an eavesdropper Eve. We also suppose that Alice and Bob are connected by an ideal quantum channel, but the eavesdropper Eve can observe any quantum system that is transmitted over the ideal channel if she so desires. The goal of a conditional quantum one-time pad proto-col is for Alice to encode a message m into her A systems, in such a way that if she sends her A systems over the ideal quantum channel, then 1. Bob can decode the message m reliably by per-forming a measurement on all of the ABE systems, while},

abstract = {Distribution of quantum correlations among remote users is a key procedure underlying many quantum in-formation technologies. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, which is one kind of such correlations stronger than entanglement, has been identified as a resource for secure quantum networks. We show that this resource can be established between two and even more distant parties by transmission of a system being separable from all the parties. For the case with two parties, we design a protocol allowing to distribute one-way Gaussian steering between them via a separable carrier; the obtained steering can be used subsequently for one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quantum key distribution. Further, we extend the protocol to three parties, a sce-nario which exhibits richer steerability properties including one-to-multimode steering and collective steering, and which can be used for 1sDI quantum secret sharing. All the proposed steering distribution protocols can be implemented with squeezed states, beam splitters and displacements, and thus they can be readily realized experimentally. Our findings reveal that not only entanglement but even steering can be distributed via commu-nication of a separable system. Viewed from a different perspective, the present protocols also demonstrate that one can switch multipartite states between different steerability classes by operations on parts of the states. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering was put forward by Schr{\"{o}}dinger [1] to describe the " spooky action-at-a-distance " phenomenon discussed in the original 1935 EPR paradox [2, 3], which allows one observer to remotely adjust ('steer') the state of another distant observer by local measure-ments. This special type of quantum correlations offers in-sights into directional nonlocality [4–14] and differs conceptu-ally from inseparable correlations aka entanglement [15, 16]. The fact that steering enables verification of shared entan-glement even when one party's measurements are untrusted [17–19] makes it an essential resource for a number of appli-cations, such as one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quan-tum key distribution (QKD) [20–23] and quantum secret shar-ing (QSS) [24–26], secure quantum teleportation [27–29], and subchannel discrimination [30, 31].},

Moreover, we construct $\backslash$prepare-and-measure" protocols for the above three cryptographic tasks which can be implemented with the generation of only a single entangled pair at a time. This gives significant simplifcation over previous experimental implementations which require two entangled pairs generated simultaneously. We also study the yields of those protocols and the threshold values of the fdelity above which the protocols can function securely. Rather surprisingly, our protocols will function securely even when the initial state does not violate the standard Bell-inequalities for GHZ states. {\textcopyright} Rinton Press.},
