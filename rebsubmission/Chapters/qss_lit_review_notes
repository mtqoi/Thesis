Planning EB QSS lit review. Let's group together papers by key message.




EB QSS is possible:
Hillery1999, Karlsson1999, Cleve1999, Gottesman1999


Generalizing GHZ protocols:
Markham2008a (generalizes to graph states)
Keet2010 (generalizes to qudit graph states)
Lau2013 (generalizes to CV cluster states)
Armstrong2015 (links with QKD, links with steering)
Ottaviani2017b (links with quantum conferencing. Star-network. MDI)
Kogias2017 (unconditional security. CV)
	Xiang2017 (links with steering. optimal states)
	Xiang2018 (might allow the requisite entangled state to be distributed)
Chen2017b (based on BPB state)
Choi2017 (allows players to check whether a key has been distilled)
Xiao2004 (more players than HBB. More efficient)
Wu2016 (CV GHZ state for conferencing and qss. MDI)

Making EB QSS more practical:
Chen2005a (allows noisy ghz states)
Chen2005b (experiment with multipartite entanglement)
Lau2013 (generalizes to CV cluster states)
Williams2019 (polarization-entangled photon pairs)
Zhang2005b (uses bell-pairs instead of multipartite entanglement)
Karlsson1999 (uses bell-pairs instead of multipartite entanglement)

Experimental EB QSS:
Gartner2007 (QSS requiring four-photon entanglement)
Bell2014 (5-qubit graph state)
Tittel2001 (PM version of HBB using entangled PDC photons)
Chen2005b (experiment with multipartite entanglement)



Planning sequential QSS lit review. Let's group together papers by message.

Sequential QSS is also possible, and may be preferable to EBQSS:
Zhang2005a (QSS using only single photons. Entanglement unnecessary.)
Schmid2005 (Sequential QSS + experiment for 6 parties. No quantum memory required. Uses heralded single photons.)
Schmid2007 (comment in response to the comment about the security of their scheme. One must be very careful to consider the flow of classical information in one of these protocols.)


Implementation of sequential QSS:
Schmid2005
Bogdanski2009 (QSS over telecom fiber network. Makes QSS very practical)
Hai-Qiang2013a (implementation over 50km fiber. Implementation of Schmid2005)
Wei2013 (same as Hai-Qiang2013a. I think they are identical papers)
Grice2019 (CV scheme with same principles as Schmid. Gaussian modulated coherent states)

Improvements to sequential QSS:
Wei2016 (published in 2018) (don't need to monitor signal disturbance. Based on RR DPS QKD)
Lu2017a (d-level quantum system. Allows for different access structures)
Asouden2017a (noisy environments)
Lu2018 (uses quantum fourier transform and generalized pauli operators. I think this paper is unfair on Schmid)
Grice2019 (claims to be immune to trojan-horse attacks, but I'm not so sure. Uses ideas from Kogias2017 for its security proof)	
Deng2005 (points out trojan-horse attack on Schmid. Proposes a solution)
Qin2006 (points out another type of attack on Schmid. Proposes a solution)

Links with other protocols:
Wei2016 (based on RR DPS QKD)
Grice2019 (can allow 2-QKD between any two parties)
Grice2015 (allows for transition between N-party QSS and 2-party QKD without changing hardware. Same quantum steps between protocols but different classical postprocesing steps.)

Problems with sequential QSS:
Schmid2007 (and the paper it responds to)
Deng2005
Qin2006
