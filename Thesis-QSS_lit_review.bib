abstract = {Secret sharing is a procedure for splitting a message into several parts so that no subset of parts is sufficient to read the message, but the entire set is. We show how this procedure can be implemented using GHZ states. In the quantum case the presence of an eavesdropper will introduce errors so that his presence can be detected. We also show how GHZ states can be used to split quantum information into two parts so that both parts are necessary to reconstruct the original qubit.},

abstract = {Secret sharing allows a trusted party (the dealer) to distribute a secret to a group of players, who can only access the secret cooperatively. Quantum secret sharing (QSS) protocols could provide unconditional security based on fundamental laws in physics. While the general security proof has been established recently in an entanglement-based QSS protocol, the tolerable channel loss is unfortunately rather small. Here we propose a continuous variable QSS protocol using conventional laser sources and homodyne detectors. In this protocol, a Gaussian-modulated coherent state (GMCS) prepared by one player passes through the secure stations of the other players sequentially, and each of the other players injects a locally prepared, independent GMCS into the circulating optical mode. Finally, the dealer measures both the amplitude and phase quadratures of the receiving optical mode using double homodyne detectors. Collectively, the players can use their encoded random numbers to estimate the measurement results of the dealer and further generate a shared key. Unlike the existing single photon based sequential QSS protocol, our scheme is intrinsically immune to Trojan horse attacks. Furthermore, the additional loss introduced by each player's system can be extremely small, which makes the protocol scalable to a large number of players. We prove the unconditional security of the proposed protocol against both eavesdroppers and dishonest players in the presence of high channel loss, and discuss various practical issues.},

@article{Xiang,
abstract = {Distribution of quantum correlations among remote users is a key procedure underlying many quantum in-formation technologies. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, which is one kind of such correlations stronger than entanglement, has been identified as a resource for secure quantum networks. We show that this resource can be established between two and even more distant parties by transmission of a system being separable from all the parties. For the case with two parties, we design a protocol allowing to distribute one-way Gaussian steering between them via a separable carrier; the obtained steering can be used subsequently for one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quantum key distribution. Further, we extend the protocol to three parties, a sce-nario which exhibits richer steerability properties including one-to-multimode steering and collective steering, and which can be used for 1sDI quantum secret sharing. All the proposed steering distribution protocols can be implemented with squeezed states, beam splitters and displacements, and thus they can be readily realized experimentally. Our findings reveal that not only entanglement but even steering can be distributed via commu-nication of a separable system. Viewed from a different perspective, the present protocols also demonstrate that one can switch multipartite states between different steerability classes by operations on parts of the states. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering was put forward by Schr{\"{o}}dinger [1] to describe the " spooky action-at-a-distance " phenomenon discussed in the original 1935 EPR paradox [2, 3], which allows one observer to remotely adjust ('steer') the state of another distant observer by local measure-ments. This special type of quantum correlations offers in-sights into directional nonlocality [4â€“14] and differs conceptu-ally from inseparable correlations aka entanglement [15, 16]. The fact that steering enables verification of shared entan-glement even when one party's measurements are untrusted [17â€“19] makes it an essential resource for a number of appli-cations, such as one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quan-tum key distribution (QKD) [20â€“23] and quantum secret shar-ing (QSS) [24â€“26], secure quantum teleportation [27â€“29], and subchannel discrimination [30, 31].},

This result yields information--theoretic formulas for the distillable secret key, giving ``ultimate'' key rate bounds if Eve is assumed to possess a purification of Alice and Bob's joint state. Specialising our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a protocol of entanglement distillation via one-way LOCC (local operations and classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the so-called "hashing inequality" which says that the coherent information (i.e., the negative conditional von Neumann entropy) is an achievable EPR rate.

The asymmetric phenomena of Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen (EPR) steering plays a key role in one-sided device-independent (1sDI) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. In the context of continuous-variable (CV) QKD schemes utilizing Gaussian states and measurements, we identify all protocols that can be 1sDI and their maximum loss tolerance. Surprisingly, this includes a protocol that uses only coherent states. We also establish a direct link between the relevant EPR steering inequality and the secret key rate, further strengthening the relationship between these asymmetric notions of nonlocality and device independence. We experimentally implement both entanglement-based and coherent-state protocols, and measure the correlations necessary for 1sDI key distribution up to an applied loss equivalent to 7.5 and 3.5 km of optical fiber transmission, respectively. We also engage in detailed modeling to understand the limits of our current experiment and the potential for further improvements. The new protocols we uncover apply the cheap and efficient hardware of CV-QKD systems in a significantly more secure setting.},

In a ((k,n)) threshold scheme, a secret quantum state is divided into n shares such that any k of those shares can be used to reconstruct the secret, but any set of k-1 or fewer shares contains absolutely no information about the secret. We show that the only constraint on the existence of threshold schemes comes from the quantum "no-cloning theorem", which requires that n {\textless} 2k, and, in all such cases, we give an efficient construction of a ((k,n)) threshold scheme. We also explore similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k {\textless}= n {\textless} 2k-1 then any ((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a mixed state.},

Complementing with the earlier proposed semi-quantum schemes for key distribution, secret sharing and deterministic secure communication, set of schemes proposed here and subsequent discussions have established that almost every secure communication and computation tasks that can be performed using fully quantum protocols can also be performed in semi-quantum manner. Further, it addresses a fundamental question in context of a large number problems- how much quantumness is (how many quantum parties are) required to perform a specific secure communication task? Some of the proposed schemes are completely orthogonal-state-based, and thus, fundamentally different from the existing semi-quantum schemes that are conjugate-coding-based.

More specifically, module division of quantum communication protocols and coupling between different modules are discussed. Our aforementioned protocol is analyzed as an example. On one hand, plenty of quantum states (the BPB-class states and the BPB-like-class states, which are proposed in this paper) could be used as carrier to perform our protocol.

abstract = {Agile cryptography allows for a resource-efficient swap of a cryptographic core in case the security of an underlying classical cryptographic algorithm becomes compromised. In this paper, we suggest how this principle can be applied to the field of quantum cryptography. We explicitly demonstrate two quantum cryptographic protocols: quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform, with protocols only differing in their classical post-processing. The system is also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver, enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are inherently multipartite and we prove that they are secure not only when a player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external) eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In the first proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile quantum communication system, the quantum states were distributed at GHz rates. This allows for a one-bit message to be securely signed using our QDS protocols in less than {\$}0.05{\$}{\~{}}ms over a {\$}2{\$}{\~{}}km fiber link and in less than {\$}0.2{\$}{\~{}}s over a {\$}20{\$}{\~{}}km fiber link.

Its theoretic efficiency is also doubled to approach 100{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The topic of information theoretic security is introduced and the principal results in this area are reviewed. The basic wire-tap channel model is considered first, and then several specific types of wire-tap channels are considered, including Gaussian, multi-input multi-output (MIMO), compound, and feedback wire-tap channels, as well as the wire-tap channel with side information. Practical code design techniques to achieve secrecy for wire-tap channels are also introduced. The wire-tap formalism is then extended to the basic channels of multi-user networks, including broadcast channels, multiple-access channels (MACs), interference channels, relay channels and two-way channels. For all of these models, results on the fundamental communication limits under secrecy constraints and corresponding coding schemes are reviewed. Furthermore, several related topics including key agreement through common randomness, secure network coding, authentication, cross-layer design, and secure source coding are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Y.

abstract = {The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox established a link between entanglement and nonlocality in quantum mechanics. EPR steering is the nonlocality associated with the EPR paradox and has traditionally only been investigated between two parties. Here, we present the first experimental observations of multipartite EPR steering, and of the genuine tripartite continuous variable entanglement of three mesoscopic optical systems. We explore different linear optics networks - each one with optimised asymmetries - that create multipartite steerable states containing different numbers of quantised optical modes (qumodes). By introducing asymmetric loss on a 7-qumode state, we characterize 8 regimes of directional steering, showing that N + 1 regimes exist for an N-qumode state. Further, we reveal the directional monogamy of steering, and experimentally demonstrate continuous variable one-sided semi device-independent quantum secret sharing. Our methods establish principles for the development of multiparty quantum communication protocols with asymmetric observers, and can be extended to qubits, whether photonic, atomic, superconducting, or otherwise.},

abstract = {Secret sharing, in which a dealer wants to split a secret in such a way that any unauthorized subset of parties is unable to reconstruct it, plays a key role in cryptography. The security of quantum protocols for the task is guaranteed by the fact that Eve's any strategies to obtain secret information from encoded quantum states should cause a disturbance in the signal. Here, we propose a quantum secret sharing (classical information) scheme for {\$}N{\$} parties based on totally different principle in which monitoring signal disturbance is no longer need. In this scheme, the secret is divided among several partners by sequential transmissions of a {\$}L{\$}-dimensional qudit state, which can be practically implemented using a conventional laser and some standard off-the-shelf components. Our scheme paves a novel and practical way for quantum secret sharing.},

In order to check the viability of these schemes under imperfect operations and noise in the channels, we consider one such scheme in detail and show that under moderate conditions it is still possible to extract viable secure shared keys in this scheme. Although we specifically consider only one type of sequential scheme and three different noise models, our method is fairly general to be applied to other QSS schemes and noise models as well.},

abstract = {Quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes without entanglement have huge advantages in scalability and are easier to realize as they only require sequential communications of a single quantum system. However, these schemes often come with drawbacks such as exact (n; n) structure, flaws in security and in lack of effective cheating detection, which need urgent optimizations. To address this, we propose a verifiable framework of utilizing entanglement-free states to construct (t; n)-QSS schemes. Our work is the first step towards perfect security in entanglement-free QSS, and it sheds light on how to establish effective verification mechanism against cheating. As a result, the proposed framework has a significant importance in constructing QSS schemes for versatile applications in quantum networks due to its intrinsic scalability, flexibility and perfect security.},

abstract = {Suppose that Alice and Bob are located in distant laboratories, which are connected by an ideal quantum channel. Suppose further that they share many copies of a quantum state $\rho$ABE, such that Alice possesses the A systems and Bob the BE systems. In our model, there is an identifiable part of Bob's laboratory that is insecure: a third party named Eve has infiltrated Bob's laboratory and gained control of the E systems. Alice, knowing this, would like use their shared state and the ideal quantum channel to communicate a message in such a way that Bob, who has access to the whole of his laboratory (BE systems), can decode it, while Eve, who has access only to a sector of Bob's laboratory (E systems) and the ideal quantum channel connecting Alice to Bob, cannot learn anything about Alice's transmitted message. We call this task the conditional one-time pad, and in this paper, we prove that the optimal rate of secret communication for this task is equal to the conditional quantum mutual information I(A; B|E) of their shared state. We thus give the conditional quantum mutual information an operational meaning that is different from those given in prior works, via state redistribution, conditional erasure, or state deconstruction. We also generalize the model and method in several ways, one of which demonstrates that the negative tripartite interaction information âˆ’I3(A; B; E) â‰¡ I(A; BE) âˆ’ I(A; B) âˆ’ I(A; E) of a tripartite state $\rho$ABE is an achievable rate for a secret-sharing task, i.e., the case in which Alice's message should be secure from someone possessing only the AB or AE systems but should be decodable by someone possessing all systems A, B, and E. Introductionâ€”The main purpose of this paper is to show that the optimal rate of a communication task, which we call the conditional one-time pad, is equal to a fundamental information quantity called the conditional quantum mutual information. To prove this statement, we operate in the regime of quantum Shannon theory, and we suppose that Alice and Bob possess a large num-ber n of copies of a quantum state $\rho$ ABE . We suppose that one party Alice has access to all of the A systems, and another party Bob has access to all of the BE sys-tems. We suppose that Bob's laboratory is divided into two parts, one of which is secure (the B part) and the other which is insecure (the E part) and accessible to an eavesdropper Eve. We also suppose that Alice and Bob are connected by an ideal quantum channel, but the eavesdropper Eve can observe any quantum system that is transmitted over the ideal channel if she so desires. The goal of a conditional quantum one-time pad proto-col is for Alice to encode a message m into her A systems, in such a way that if she sends her A systems over the ideal quantum channel, then 1. Bob can decode the message m reliably by per-forming a measurement on all of the ABE systems, while},
