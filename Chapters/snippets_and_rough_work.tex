\subsection{Entangling-cloner attack}
More powerful than the beamsplitter attack is the entangling cloner attack, Fig.~\MT{X}, which gives Bob considerably more power to exploit both the loss and the noise of the channel. This attack therefore is naturally suited to the realistic case of nonzero excess noise $\xi$, while for $\xi \rightarrow 0$ it reduces back to the beamsplitter attack.
