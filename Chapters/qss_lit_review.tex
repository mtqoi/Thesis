\section{How to share a secret}
\MT{introductory remarks}
Such schemes are regularly employed in \MT{context}, the canonical example being that of a bank. The head of the bank, Alice, wishes to distribute keys to its vault between several deputies, any unknown subset of whom may be dishonest. If the deputies work together and use their keys simultaneously they are able to access the vault, but any nefarious deputies working along should not be able to gain access.

\subsection*{Classical secret sharing}
Although many existing secret-sharing schemes are already information-theoretically secure while relying only on classical resources \MT{cite}, they may encounter problems when distribution shares of the secret across insecure channels. \MT{talk in more detail about an information-theoretically secure classical scheme} This is analogous to the classical unconditionally secure signature schemes discussed in Sec.~\MT{X}. Secure implementation of a scheme such as \MT{X} requires shared secret keys which, in reality, requires QKD. Thus we may ask whether it is more or less resource-efficient to first run pairwise QKD between players, or to run a "direct"-QSS scheme without first distilling pairwise secret keys.

We should expect interesting parallels between QSS and QKD. As was noted by Simmons \MT{cite}, \MT{quote about secret sharing and key distribution}.

It is important to notice that the translation from classical secret sharing to quantum secret sharing is not straightforward. There are at least three directions which one can pursue in order to perform a secret sharing task using quantum mechanics:

\begin{itemize}
\item quantum-assisted classical secret sharing (qCSS): encrypt a classical secret sharing protocol (e.g. Shamir \MT{cite}) using quantum resources. For example, perform pairwise QKD between Alice and each recipient, then encrypt the shares of the classical secret sharing protocol
\item quantum secret sharing (QSS): use quantum states to securely distribute shares of a classical secret
\item quantum state sharing (QStS): securely distribute shares of a quantum state
\end{itemize}

Quantum state sharing is an important and exciting research direction in its own right and helps to establish the close links between quantum secret sharing, QKD and quantum teleportation \MT{cite some stuff}. Despite the fact that both QSS and QStS are natural extensions of classical secret sharing to the quantum realm, , and despite the fact that early work \MT{cite} proposes related protocols for each task, it should be understood that the two are distinct quantum tasks with different goals and hardware requirements, so for the rest of this Thesis we will restrict ourselves to QSS. In what follows we will only refer to the first two options as quantum secret sharing, while the third option we shall refer to as quantum state sharing.

\subsection{Entanglement-based QSS}


All three directions are discussed at length in the pioneering work by Hillery \emph{et. al.} \cite{Hillery1999}. They propose the use of a GHZ resource state Eq.~\MT{X} shared between three players, which can be used to distribute shares of a classical secret such that collaborating recipients can recover the secret while a dishonest subset of players cannot. Alternatively, the GHZ resource state may be used to distribute shares of a quantum state, such that collaborating players may reconstruct the original quantum state while a dishonest subset of players can gain no information.

Each player chooses independently and at random to measure their state in either the $x$ or $y$ basis \MT{define these}. If for example \MT{give an example of the type of calculation that lets players recover the state. Just copy it from the HBB paper}.  Crucially, knowledge of the outcomes of two players allows one to infer the outcome of the third player. 

Despite its high resource requirement, and despite the fact that $50\%$ of the resource states are wasted \MT{why?} the HBB protocol has influenced the direction of all subsequent QSS protocols, and the paper was instrumental in demonstrating that multipartite entanglement may be utilized as an important resource for quantum communication protocols. 
\MT{Should I talk somewhere about qCSS in HBB paper?}

Multipartite entanglement is difficult to create and manipulate, and will degrade quickly as it is distributed over a quantum channel exposed to realistic loss or noise levels. Just as QKD has an equivalence between entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure versions \MT{Talk about ekert and BB92?}, it should be expected that the requirement of large multipartite state in Ref.~\cite{Hillery1999} can likewise be reduced \cite{Karlsson1999, Tittel2001, Zhang2005b, Williams2019}. Karlsson \emph{et. al.} \cite{Karlsson1999} propose an entanglement-based QSS scheme which, rather than relying on creation and distribution of the GHZ state, relies on distribution of \emph{pairs} of entangled qubits in a Bell state. 

This configuration allows for correlations between players to be established identically to HBB with more readily accessible resources. Recipients Bob and Charlie can determine with certainty which Bell state Alice sent, which allows Alice to establish a key with Bob/Charlie, which may subsequently be used to encrypt a message. \MT{demonstrate that it can give the same measurement outcomes as HBB with GHZ.}

This protocol drastically reduces the requirements of practical QSS, but the resulting protocol is still non-trivial to implement. The protocol requires Bell states and superpositions of Bell states which will all be degraded over a realistic channel. 

These protocols also introduces a fundamental asymmetry into QSS at the quantum level. While in the HBB protocol any of the three players can be chosen as dealer \MT{check this}, for Ref.~\cite{Karlsson1999} it is established at the time of quantum state distribution that Alice is dealer, which may make the protocol require bespoke hardware.

Both of these protocols \cite{Hillery1999, Karlsson1999} assume both perfect state creation and noiseless and lossless quantum channels. This is an unrealistic assumption and one which must be relaxed before entanglement-based QSS can be implemented securely. Chen \emph{et. al.} \cite{Chen2005a} modify the HBB protocol to the case when the resource state is a noisy-GHZ state. By proposing a method for distillation of multipartite entangled states which may be used before a communication protocol--such as QSS or quantum conferencing--requiring multiparite entanglement as a resource, their entire protocol allows for successful QSS even when the resource state does not violate a Bell inequality.


An important generalization of the HBB scheme allows for analysis of some of the optimal entangled states required to share a secret between more than three players. While one option would be to simply replace the resource state with the N-partite GHZ state

\MT{insert equation}
\MT{problems with npartite GHZ state}

\noindent another option is to generalize to graph states \cite{Markham2008a, Keet2010} or continuous-variable cluster states \cite{Lau2013, Wu2016} under which the tasks qCSS, QSS, QStS and entanglement-based QKD may be united and described within the same framework. A graph state is \MT{add a description}. One advantage of using such a state is that it can allow fro QSS to be completed without collaboration from all recipients, which may help practical QSS to be robust and prevent against denial-of-service attacks from a dishonest internal player\footnote{Though we note that even QKD is susceptible to denial-of-service attack where Eve simply destroys the quantum (or classical) channels between Alice and Bob.}

There have been several attempts to prove security of entanglement-based QSS. As we have seen, security proofs based on highly-entangled GHZ states or graph states become insecure once realistic channel parameters are considered, even though they offer unconditional security in the ideal limit. One way to tackle this is to borrow tools from entanglement-based QKD. Kogias \emph{et. al.} use similar analysis to so-called one-sided device-independent ($1$sDI) QKD \cite{Armstrong2015} \MT{check it is this paper} in order to prove QSS security while modelling channel effects on their CV resource state.

Key to Kogias' protocol is the assumption that neither the measurement device of Bob nor of Charlie should be trusted. Rather, each player is assumed to possess a black-box which can output one of two measurement outcomes, corresponding in the honest case to homodyne measurement in either $x$ or $p$ quadrature. Protocol security is based on monogamy of entanglement \MT{cite} and employs an entropic uncertainty relation which makes no assumption about the action of a dishonest player, by analogy with $1$sDI QKD. To our knowledge Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017} marked the first full security proof of QSS. It was later shown that the resource required for entanglement-based QSS is two-way steering of the shared state \cite{Xiang2017, Xiang2018}, and the optimal Gaussian resource states for a given energy were also considered. 

The links between QSS and $1$sDI QKD explored in Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017} hint at an interesting direction for exploration: what is the relationship between QSS and other quantum communication protocols? It was already shown in Ref.~\cite{Markham2008a} that qCSS, QSS and QStS may be united under the same framework using graph states, while even in the original HBB work \cite{Hillery1999} the links between qCSS (classical secret sharing + QKD) and QSS were acknowledged. Additionally it can be shown \MT{cite} that a QStS protocol may be readily constructed from a teleportation protocol plus QSS (or qCSS or QKD) scheme if Alice teleports a quantum state to Bob, but sends the classical information required for state reconstruction to Charlie.

There are strong links between QSS and quantum conferencing \cite{Wu2016, Ottaviani2017b} which is a natural multipartite generalization of QKD in which $N$ players receive identical keys. Indeed, as shown in Refs.~\cite{Wu2016, Ottaviani2017b} the same resource states and network configurations may be readily used for both QSS and quantum conferencing. It is an open question however whether these additional tasks have the same requirements \cite{Kogias2017, Xiang2017} on the resource state as QSS, or whether the optimal resource state for one protocol remains optimal for another protocol. Indeed, perhaps it is unsurprising that there should be such strong links between QSS and QKD since it was acknowledged by Simmons that
