\section{How to share a secret}\label{sec:qss_lit_review}
\MT{introductory remarks}
Such schemes are regularly employed in \MT{context}, the canonical example being that of a bank. The head of the bank, Alice, wishes to distribute keys to its vault between several deputies, any unknown subset of whom may be dishonest. If the deputies work together and use their keys simultaneously they are able to access the vault, but any nefarious deputies working along should not be able to gain access.

\subsection*{Classical secret sharing}
Although many existing secret-sharing schemes are already information-theoretically secure while relying only on classical resources \MT{cite}, they may encounter problems when distribution shares of the secret across insecure channels. \MT{talk in more detail about an information-theoretically secure classical scheme} This is analogous to the classical unconditionally secure signature schemes discussed in Sec.~\MT{X}. Secure implementation of a scheme such as \MT{X} requires shared secret keys which, in reality, requires QKD. Thus we may ask whether it is more or less resource-efficient to first run pairwise QKD between players, or to run a "direct"-QSS scheme without first distilling pairwise secret keys. We should expect interesting parallels between QSS and QKD, since intuitively they are very similar, and rely on encryption of classical messages.

Let us consider some examples. Alice wishes to share a secret $m$ between $n$ players, such that any $k$ of them can access $m$. The general framework for this is an $\left(n, k\right)$-threshold scheme, where there are $n$ players in total and any subset of $k$ players can reconstruct the secret. An example of an information-theoretically secure threshold sharing scheme was designed by Shamir in Ref.~\MT{X}. Shamir's scheme relies on polynomial equations and is provably secure even against an adversary with infinite computing power. 

For example, Alice wishes to distribute a secret $m$ between four players, such that any three of them can access $m$. Alice generates a prime number $p$, and the polynomial \MT{what does it mean to add $m$ to a polynomial? TODO: read Shamir's original paper. why do we need to take it modulo p?}
\begin{equation}
\left( a x^2 + b x + m \right) \text{modulo} p.
\end{equation}
Prime $p$ should be chosen larger than any of the coefficients $a, b$ or $m$. Alice then evaluates this polynomial at $4$ different points $x$, and sends the outcomes to each player. These points will be referred to as ``shares".

The polynomial has three unknown coefficients, $a$, $b$ and $m$, and so any three players can combine their shares to create three equations, which may be solved for each unknown. Any fewer points will yield an underdefined system which cannot be solved. An attempt to guess the final share will show that any such message $m$ can be the secret and so such a guessing attempt is useless.

Another analogous threshold secret sharing scheme was built on similar principles by Blakley \MT{cite}. In Blakley's scheme, the message $m$ is defined as a point in a large $k$ dimensional space. Each share is then a hyperplane in a $k-1$~dimensional space, which includes the point $m$. It therefore requires the intersection of all $k$ hyperplanes to reveal $m$. For example, if Alice again wishes to share a secret between four players, such that three of them are able to access $m$, then each share is a two-dimensional plane. The intersection of any two planes is a one-dimensional line containing $m$, and the third plane is required to reduce this line to the point $m$.

While both of these schemes are information-theoretically secure once the shares have been distributed (assuming that each share is securely stored and cannot be stolen), the main issue arises when considering how the shares can be distributed in the first place. If a malevolent party can access the shares while Alice distributes them, then they can reconstruct the secret. In implementation, Shamir's and Blakley's schemes are therefore only as secure as the underlying encryption used to share the shares.

\subsection{Quantum secret sharing}
One might therefore wish to investigate whether the task of secret sharing can be made secure using quantum resources. It is important to notice that the translation from classical secret sharing to quantum secret sharing is not straightforward. There are at least three directions which one can pursue in order to perform a secret sharing task using quantum mechanics:

\begin{itemize}
\item quantum-assisted classical secret sharing (qCSS): encrypt a classical secret sharing protocol (e.g. Shamir \MT{cite}) using quantum resources. For example, perform pairwise QKD between Alice and each recipient, then encrypt the shares of the classical secret sharing protocol
\item quantum secret sharing (QSS): use quantum states to securely distribute shares of a classical secret
\item quantum state sharing (QStS): securely distribute shares of a quantum state
\end{itemize}

Quantum state sharing is an important and exciting research direction in its own right and helps to establish the close links between quantum secret sharing, QKD and quantum teleportation \MT{cite some stuff}. Despite the fact that both QSS and QStS are natural extensions of classical secret sharing to the quantum realm, , and despite the fact that early work \MT{cite} proposes related protocols for each task, it should be understood that the two are distinct quantum tasks with different goals and hardware requirements, so for the rest of this Thesis we will restrict ourselves to QSS. In what follows we will only refer to the first two options as quantum secret sharing, while the third option we shall refer to as quantum state sharing.

\subsection{Entanglement-based QSS}

%\MT{I can add a fuller explanation of HBB (and the other protocols), since I go into quite some depth in QDS lit review.}
All three directions are discussed at length in the pioneering work by Hillery \emph{et. al.} \cite{Hillery1999}. They propose the use of a GHZ resource state Eq.~\MT{X} shared between three players, which can be used to distribute shares of a classical secret such that collaborating recipients can recover the secret while a dishonest subset of players cannot. Alternatively, the GHZ resource state may be used to distribute shares of a quantum state, such that collaborating players may reconstruct the original quantum state while a dishonest subset of players can gain no information.

Each player chooses independently and at random to measure their state in either the $x$ or $y$ basis \MT{define these}. If for example \MT{give an example of the type of calculation that lets players recover the state. Just copy it from the HBB paper}.  Crucially, knowledge of the outcomes of two players allows one to infer the outcome of the third player.  \MT{talk about how this actually helps to distribute a secret.}

Despite its high resource requirement, and despite the fact that $50\%$ of the resource states are wasted \MT{why?} the HBB protocol has influenced the direction of all subsequent QSS protocols, and the paper was instrumental in demonstrating that multipartite entanglement may be utilized as an important resource for quantum communication protocols. 
\MT{Should I talk somewhere about qCSS in HBB paper?}

Multipartite entanglement is difficult to create and manipulate, and will degrade quickly as it is distributed over a quantum channel exposed to realistic loss or noise levels. Just as QKD has an equivalence between entanglement-based and prepare-and-measure versions \MT{Talk about ekert and BB92?}, it should be expected that the requirement of large multipartite state in Ref.~\cite{Hillery1999} can likewise be reduced \cite{Karlsson1999, Tittel2001, Zhang2005b, Williams2019}. Karlsson \emph{et. al.} \cite{Karlsson1999} propose an entanglement-based QSS scheme which, rather than relying on creation and distribution of the GHZ state, relies on distribution of \emph{pairs} of entangled qubits in a Bell state. 

This configuration allows for correlations between players to be established identically to HBB with more readily accessible resources. Recipients Bob and Charlie can determine with certainty which Bell state Alice sent, which allows Alice to establish a key with Bob/Charlie, which may subsequently be used to encrypt a message. \MT{demonstrate that it can give the same measurement outcomes as HBB with GHZ.}

This protocol drastically reduces the requirements of practical QSS, but the resulting protocol is still non-trivial to implement. The protocol requires Bell states and superpositions of Bell states which will all be degraded over a realistic channel. 

These protocols also introduces a fundamental asymmetry into QSS at the quantum level. While in the HBB protocol any of the three players can be chosen as dealer \MT{check this}, for Ref.~\cite{Karlsson1999} it is established at the time of quantum state distribution that Alice is dealer, which may make the protocol require bespoke hardware.

Both of these protocols \cite{Hillery1999, Karlsson1999} assume both perfect state creation and noiseless and lossless quantum channels. This is an unrealistic assumption and one which must be relaxed before entanglement-based QSS can be implemented securely. Chen \emph{et. al.} \cite{Chen2005a} modify the HBB protocol to the case when the resource state is a noisy-GHZ state. By proposing a method for distillation of multipartite entangled states which may be used before a communication protocol--such as QSS or quantum conferencing--requiring multiparite entanglement as a resource, their entire protocol allows for successful QSS even when the resource state does not violate a Bell inequality.


An important generalization of the HBB scheme allows for analysis of some of the optimal entangled states required to share a secret between more than three players. While one option would be to simply replace the resource state with the N-partite GHZ state

\MT{insert equation}
\MT{problems with npartite GHZ state}

\noindent another option is to generalize to graph states \cite{Markham2008a, Keet2010} or continuous-variable cluster states \cite{Lau2013, Wu2016} under which the tasks qCSS, QSS, QStS and entanglement-based QKD may be united and described within the same framework. A graph state is \MT{add a description}. One advantage of using such a state is that it can allow fro QSS to be completed without collaboration from all recipients, which may help practical QSS to be robust and prevent against denial-of-service attacks from a dishonest internal player\footnote{Though we note that even QKD is susceptible to denial-of-service attack where Eve simply destroys the quantum (or classical) channels between Alice and Bob.}

There have been several attempts to prove security of entanglement-based QSS. As we have seen, security proofs based on highly-entangled GHZ states or graph states become insecure once realistic channel parameters are considered, even though they offer unconditional security in the ideal limit. One way to tackle this is to borrow tools from entanglement-based QKD. Kogias \emph{et. al.} use similar analysis to so-called one-sided device-independent ($1$sDI) QKD \cite{Armstrong2015} \MT{check it is this paper} in order to prove QSS security while modelling channel effects on their CV resource state.

Key to Kogias' protocol is the assumption that neither the measurement device of Bob nor of Charlie should be trusted. Rather, each player is assumed to possess a black-box which can output one of two measurement outcomes, corresponding in the honest case to homodyne measurement in either $x$ or $p$ quadrature. Protocol security is based on monogamy of entanglement \MT{cite} and employs an entropic uncertainty relation which makes no assumption about the action of a dishonest player, by analogy with $1$sDI QKD. To our knowledge Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017} marked the first full security proof of QSS. It was later shown that the resource required for entanglement-based QSS is two-way steering of the shared state \cite{Xiang2017, Xiang2018}, and the optimal Gaussian resource states for a given energy were also considered. 

The links between QSS and $1$sDI QKD explored in Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017} hint at an interesting direction for exploration: what is the relationship between QSS and other quantum communication protocols? It was already shown in Ref.~\cite{Markham2008a} that qCSS, QSS and QStS may be united under the same framework using graph states, while even in the original HBB work \cite{Hillery1999} the links between qCSS (classical secret sharing + QKD) and QSS were acknowledged. Additionally it can be shown \MT{cite} that a QStS protocol may be readily constructed from a teleportation protocol plus QSS (or qCSS or QKD) scheme if Alice teleports a quantum state to Bob, but sends the classical information required for state reconstruction to Charlie.

There are strong links between QSS and quantum conferencing \cite{Wu2016, Ottaviani2017b} which is a natural multipartite generalization of QKD in which $N$ players receive identical keys. Indeed, as shown in Refs.~\cite{Wu2016, Ottaviani2017b} the same resource states and network configurations may be readily used for both QSS and quantum conferencing. It is an open question however whether these additional tasks have the same requirements \cite{Kogias2017, Xiang2017} on the resource state as QSS, or whether the optimal resource state for one protocol remains optimal for another protocol.

\subsection{Sequential QSS}
Although the above protocols which implement QSS using entangled resource states offer an advanced level of security and neatly demonstrate the important role of entanglement in quantum communication, it is hard to see how they will be preferable to qCSS which can offer equivalent levels of security but without the problems associated with generation and distribution of large entangled states. An entanglement-based scheme may even be fine if the number of players is small--for example the schemes \cite{Karlsson1999} \MT{and others} only relying on Bell-pairs--they cannot be easily scaled to many parties. We note that qCSS scales much more favourably as the number of required quantum channels is linear in the total number of players.

It should still be explored whether there are any QSS protocols which outperform qCSS. One promising direction is that of sequential QSS\footnote{This is sometimes referred to as entanglement-free QSS} in which the QSS task is fulfilled by sharing of a single quantum system between multiple players.

In the first sequential QSS protocol \cite{Zhang2005}, Zhang \emph{et. al.} propose a system in which Bob prepares a single photon state with his choice of polarization, and sends it to Charlie. Charlie performs a unitary operation \MT{what does he do?} on the photon and sends it to Alice, who stores the photon in a quantum memory. This process is repeated many times. Later, Alice will sample some of her stored photons for errors \MT{how?}, and on the remaining photons she performs her unitaries \MT{what are they?} and sends them back to Charlie. \MT{how does the rest of the protocol run?}

Just as prepare-and-measure QKD allows Alice and Bob to mimic the measurement outcomes of a shared entangled state \MT{is it only when they measure in the same basis?} under \MT{criterion} the scheme \cite{Zhang2005} allows players to receive the same measurement outcomes they would if they had shared a GHZ state. Secret sharing then may proceed in the usual way. \MT{talk about this.}

Sequential protocols have the obvious advantage that large entangled states are not required. Even though Ref.~\cite{Zhang2005} proposes to use a quantum memory it is ultimately not necessary for the protocol \MT{talk some more about this.}
