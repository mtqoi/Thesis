\section{Our QSS protocol}

Our quantum secret-sharing scheme allows for a dealer, Alice, to distribute a classical secret between two recipients, Bob and Charlie. Bob and Charlie should be able to exactly reconstruct the secret when they behave honestly, while a dishonest and unauthorised conspiracy of players--including those outside the protocol--should gain no information. Crucially, the scheme should allow for dishonesty among the recipients, but a dishonest player should be forced to collaborate with an honest one.

We propose a QSS protocol which will perform the task of quantum secret sharing without requiring the distribution of highly entangled states between players (in contrast to Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017}) and without requiring a dedicated hardware or network setup (in contrast to Ref.~\MT{cite}). Instead, we rely on the QPSK alphabet \MT{cite} and heterodyne detection \MT{cite} 
\MT{make sure that this description mirrors what I have put in the QDS chapter}

\MT{I don't want to say too much about compatibility with the QDS protocol or QKD here, since this should wait until the agility chapter}

In our protocol, Bob and Charlie are chosen as the senders of the quantum states. This has the advantage of \MT{something}, and allows us to fully trust Alice's heterodyne detection. We note that allowing Bob or Charlie to perform heterodyne detection places implicit trust in their heterodyning beamsplitter \MT{cite 1sDI paper}. Instead, in our configuration we may trust and characterise Alice's device, and exploit the fact that \emph{at least one} recipient is honest, even though Alice does not know which recipient it is.

\end{figure}

Since Alice is the dealer who will decide on the eventual shared key our protocol is analogous to a reverse-reconciliation (RR) QKD system, and so we may similarly expect the performance benefits of RR QKD at high loss and noise. We note that having potentially untrusted players as the senders may open the protocol up to new classes of attack, e.g. if they are permitted to send a state which is outside the QPSK alphabet, and such attacks should be addressed in future work.

\MT{talk somewhere about the types of attack we allow}

%OOur QSS protocol runs as follows.
Our QSS protocol runs in three stages, a Distribution stage, an Encryption stage and, finally, a Decryption stage. The Distribution stage involves distribution and measurement of quantum coherent states chosen from QPSK alphabet. At the end of Distribution Alice will hold classical information which is correlated with Bob and Charlie. In the Encryption stage, Alice will combine her classical information and use it to encode her sensitive classical secret. The encoded secret is distributed to Bob and Charlie. The secret is decoded by Bob and Charlie during Decryption. Our protocol setup is described in Fig.~\ref{fig:qss_setup}, and we describe it in detail below.

\MT{make sure that the following is in the same style as my qds protocol description}

\subsubsection*{Distribution stage}
\noindent \underline{Step $1$.} Alice wishes to encrypt a classical secret, $\sigma$. Bob forms a classical sequence $X_B = \left\{x_B^j\right\}_j$ where the $x_B^j$ are complex phases independently chosen from $\mathcal{A}_4$. The $x_B^j$ are assumed to be chosen uniformly at random, but we relax this assumption slightly in Ch.~\MT{X}. Charlie likewise forms $X_C$.

\noindent \underline{Step $2$.} Bob and Charlie form sequences of coherent states
\begin{equation}
\rho\left[X_{\left(B, C\right)}\right] := \otimes_j \rho\left[x_{\left(B, C\right)}^j\right]
\end{equation}
where $\rho\left[x_{\left(B, C\right)^j}\right]$ denotes a coherent state with phase $x_{\left(B, C\right)}^j$. These sequences of states are sent to Alice through quantum channels. \MT{Talk later about the types of channels which these are.}. Alice performs heterodyne detection on each of her received states and records her complex outcomes. We denote strings of Alice's measurement outcomes as $A_B, A_C \in \mathbb{C}$, where the subscript denotes which player sent the corresponding quantum state. The $A_B$ and $A_C$ are kept separate at this stage, and Bob and Charlie should retain their information $X_{\left(B, C\right)}$.

\subsubsection*{Encryption stage}

\noindent \underline{Step $3$.} Alice creates a new complex variable
\begin{equation}
X_A = F\left(A_B, A_C\right)
\end{equation}
from her measurement outcomes. The function $F$ is chosen by Alice and should be freely chosen to optimize security. \MT{Where shall I talk about function $F$?} \MT{I can create some nice graphs of different functions $F$, even those requiring a lot of parameters to be optimized over. But when it comes to actually analysing security I should pick simple ones.} 

\noindent \underline{Step $4$.} Alice now holds string $X_A$ which depends on both Bob and Charlie's choices of states to send. She then uses $X_A$ to encode $\sigma$
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\sigma} = \text{Enc}\left(\sigma, X_A\right)
\end{equation}
\MT{Talk briefly about how this might be done, e.g. with reference to QKD}
and distributes $\tilde{\sigma}$ to Bob and Charlie. Because Bob and Charlie do not have $X_A$ they cannot gain $\sigma$.

\subsubsection*{Decryption stage}

\noindent \underline{Step $5$.} Later, when Alice desires to allow Bob and Charlie access to $\sigma$, she broadcasts which function $F$ she used, along with enough classical information to perform a reconciliation procedure between $X_A$ and $F\left(X_B, X_C\right)$. This stage is similar to regular CV QKD. Bob and Charlie, by working together to form and reconcile $F\left(X_B, X_C\right)$ gain a copy of Alice's key, and are now able to access her secret $\sigma$.

Critical to the protocol is the fact that Alice forms a secret key based on a degree of freedom which is shared between Bob and Charlie. This forces them to collaborate. If one of Bob or Charlie is dishonest, they are forced to work with an honest player and so the scheme as succeeded.

\MT{TODO: convert the strings $X_{A, B, C}$ into random variables describing the classical information, rather than classical strings. It'll make notation in the security proof easier.}

\MT{some more remarks about the running of the protocol}


\section{Security against Eve}
\MT{talk here about security against an external eavesdropper.}

The QSS protocol presented above must be secure against both the actions of an external eavesdropper and the actions of a dishonest Bob or Charlie, who may collaborate with Eve. We first consider just an external Eve to illustrate key steps from the security analysis, an a dishonest Bob or Charlie is considered in the next section.

The starting point for our security analysis is the following Devetak-Winter key-rate bound \MT{cite} \MT{should I motivate why this bound is helpful for us?}

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_dw_eve}
\kappa_{Eve} \ge \text{I}\left(X_A : X_B, X_C\right) - \chi\left(X_A : \mathbb{E}\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent which describes the balance between the mutual information $\text{I}$ shared between Alice and a Bob-Charlie collaboration, and the Holevo information between Eve's quantum system $\mathbb{E}$ and Alice. It is unsurprising that Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_dw_eve} should be our starting point given the noted similarities between QSS and QKD. The $X_A = F\left(X_B, X_C\right)$ is Alice's variable.

We will consider each term in Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_dw_eve} in turn.

\subsubsection{Mutual information}

Using Eq.~\MT{X} the mutual information may be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_1}
\text{I}\left(X_A : X_B, X_C\right) = \text{H}\left(X_B, X_C\right) - \text{H} \left(X_B, X_C \given X_A\right)
\end{equation}
where the first term on the right hand side is the joint Shannon entropy of $X_B$ and $X_C$, and the second term is the conditional Shannon entropy of $X_B, X_C$ given $X_A$. Intuitively this second term encodes the uncertainty one has about which $X_B, X_C$ were chosen, given a particular choice for $X_A$. 

The joint Shannon entropy may be written
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_2}
\text{H}\left(X_B, X_C\right) = \sum_{X_B=b, X_C=c} - \text{P}\left(b, c\right) \log \text{P}\left(b, c\right)
\end{equation}
where $b, c$ are individual instances of variables $X_B, X_C$. The $b, c \in \mathcal{A}_4$. Since $b, c$ are taken to be independently chosen and uniformly random we see that the joint probability
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_3}
\text{P}\left(b, c\right) = \text{P}\left(b\right)\times \text{P}\left(c\right) = \frac{1}{16}
\end{equation}
since each of the $b, c$ are chosen with probability $1/4$. 

Expanding the conditional probability in the prior \MT{is this the right term?} variable $X_A$ we reach

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_4}
\text{H}\left(X_B, X_C \given X_A\right) = \int\limits_{a \in \mathbb{C}} \Diff2 a \; \text{P}\left(X_A = a\right) \text{H}\left(X_B, X_C \given X_A = a\right).
\end{equation}
Each term in Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_deriv_4} can be calculated theoretically once function $F$ is known. 

We have no requirement that $F$ should be injective. In particular, this implies that \MT{X}. To be concrete, in what follows we assume that $F$ is linear
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_F_linear}
F\left(x, y\right) := g x + h y \qq{with} g, h \in \mathbb{R}\setminus \left\{0\right\}
\end{equation} 
Although we make no claims about the optimality of this choice of $F$, we are free to optimize over $g, h$, and we will make it clear when we have done so. The conditional entropy in the integrand of Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_deriv_4} expands as \MT{make equation look nice}

\begin{align}
\text{H}\left(X_B, X_C \given X_A\right) = \sum_{b, c \in \mathcal{A}_4} - &\text{P}\left(X_B=b, X_C=c \given X_A=a\right) \times \notag \\
%
&\log \text{P}\left(X_B=b, X_C=c \given X_A=a\right)
\end{align}

\noindent and so all that remains to calculate are the probabilities \begin{equation}
\text{P}\left(X_A=a\right) \qq{and} \text{P}\left(X_B=b, X_C=c \given X_A=a\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent Applying Bayes' formula to the second of these, we see that
\begin{equation}
\text{P}\left(X_B=b, X_C=c \given X_A=a\right) = \text{P}\left(X_A=a \given X_B=b, X_C=c\right) \frac{\text{P}\left(X_B=b, X_C=c\right)}{\text{P}\left(X_A=a\right)}.
\end{equation}
We can access $\text{P}\left(X_A=a \given X_B=b, X_C=c\right)$ by modelling the effects of the channel on quantum states distributed by Bob and Charlie, which we now do. We take
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_5}
X_A = F\left(A_B, A_C\right) = g A_B + h A_C
\end{equation}
and thus
\begin{equation}
A_C = \frac{X_A - g A_B}{h}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Since our $F$ is not injective (there are multiple $A_B, A_C$ which will give the same $X_A$) we must average over all of the possible ways to reach a given $X_A$. Therefore, once $X_A$ is fixed, the choice of $A_B, A_C$ reduces to a one-variable problem and so

\begin{equation}
\text{P}\left(X_A \given X_B=b, X_C=c\right) = \int\limits_{A_B \in \mathbb{C}} \Diff2 A_B \; \text{P}\left(A_B , \frac{X_A - g A_B}{h} \given X_B=b, X_C=c\right)
\end{equation}
which may be calculated once we know how the channel acts on input states. A similar equation would be reached by rearranging Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_deriv_5} as $A_B = \left(X_A - h A_C\right)/g$ but it will make no difference to the resulting quantities.

Assuming that the channel Charlie-Alice is independent from the channel Bob-Charlie\footnote{We shall see later what this physically corresponds to} allows us to write
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_6}
\text{P}\left(A_B, A_C \given X_b=b, X_C=c\right) = \text{P}\left(A_B \given X_B=b\right) \times \text{P}\left(A_C \given X_C=c\right)
\end{equation}
for Alice's heterodyne measurement outcomes $A_B, A_C$. Let us assume for now that each channel is noiseless but lossy. The probability that Alice measures a particular heterodyne outcome $a \in \mathbb{C}$ when a coherent state of complex amplitude $\beta$ is sent through a lossy channel, transmittivity $T$, is 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_channel_classical_prob}
\frac{1}{\pi}\exp\left( - \left| a - \sqrt{T}\beta \right|^2\right)
\end{equation}
which we have used previously in Ch.~\MT{X}. The required changes to include thermal noise of the channel can be readily made.

The integral in Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_deriv_6} may be calculated analytically to reach \MT{TODO: check this against my MMA file}
\begin{align}\label{eqn:qss_deriv_7}
\text{P}\left(X_A \given X_B=b, X_C=c\right) = \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{1}{g^2 + h^2} &\exp \left( - \frac{\left[b^R g \sqrt{T_B} + c^R h \sqrt{T_C} - X_A^R \right]^2}{g^2 + h^2}\right) \notag \\
%
&\exp \left( - \frac{\left[b^I g \sqrt{T_B} + c^I h \sqrt{T_C} - X_A^I \right]^2}{g^2 + h^2} \right)
\end{align}
where $b, c$ are Bob and Charlie's coherent state amplitudes, $X_A$ is Alice's final variable after applying $F$ to her heterodyne outcomes, $T_B, T_C$ are the transmittivities of the Bob-Alice channel and Charlie-Alice channel, respectively, and where a superscript $R\left(I\right)$ denotes the real (imaginary) part of the corresponding quantity. \MT{I probably don't need to say much about how this integration is actually done, since it should be obvious.} The probability $\text{P}\left(X_A=a\right)$ may be readily found by summing Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_deriv_7} over $b, c \in \mathcal{A}_4$. 

Finally, the mutual information Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_deriv_1} may be calculated. \MT{Q: do I explicitly perform the integral over $X_A$? If so then I should show it. Otherwise I should mention that it is performed numerically.}

Let us now explore how the mutual information behaves. \MT{Now let's make some graphs and really have fun exploring how $I$ behaves.}

\subsubsection{Holevo information}

We will now detail how the Holevo information term in Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_dw_eve} may be calculated. In doing so we will point to areas where future work might strengthen the security analysis to wider classes of attack, which should help to illuminate the contexts to which our security proof may be applied. In this section we consider a dishonest Eve performing attack BS$0$, as detailed above in Sec.~\MT{X}, and more general attacks will be considered later.

Bob and Charlie prepare a state from QPSK alphabet with equal probability. The coherent states should be independently and randomly chosen. Before the channel they hold the joint state
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{before}} = \rho_B \otimes \rho_C
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\rho_B = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=0}^3 \dyad{\beta_k}_B \qq{and} \rho_C = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k^\prime = 0}^3 \dyad{\gamma_{k^\prime}}_C
\end{equation}
where $\beta, \gamma$ are the amplitudes of Bob's and Charlie's coherent state alphabets.\footnote{Complex amplitudes $\beta, \gamma$ were denoted $b, c$ in the previous section.}

We assume that the channel acts separately on each mode, and that modes $\rho_B$, $\rho_C$ undergo independent evolution. In other words, we assume that the channel has tensor-product structure
\begin{equation}
\Phi\left[\rho\right] = \Phi_B\left[\rho\right] \otimes \Phi_C\left[\rho\right]
\end{equation}
where \MT{check this equation}
\begin{equation}
\Phi_B\left[\rho\right] = \phi_B\left(\text{Tr}_B \rho\right) \otimes \mathbb{1}\left(\rho\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent Eve performs separate beamsplitter attacks on each channed and retains two output modes $\mathbb{E}_{B, C}$. The total state after the channel becomes
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{after}} = \rho_{\mathbb{A}_B, \mathbb{E}_B} \otimes \rho_{\mathbb{A}_C, \mathbb{E}_C}
\end{equation}
with $\mathbb{A}_{B, C}$ denoting Alice's two modes and where
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\mathbb{A}_B, \mathbb{E}_B} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{k=0}^3 \dyad{\sqrt{T_B} \beta_k}_{\mathbb{A}_B} \otimes \dyad{\sqrt{1-T_B} \beta_k}_{\mathbb{E}_B}
\end{equation}
and similarly for $\rho_{\mathbb{A}_C, \mathbb{E}_C}$. Now, Alice heterodynes and measures $A_B \in \mathbb{C}$ from $\rho_{\mathbb{A}_B, \mathbb{E}_B}$ and $A_C \in \mathbb{C}$ from $\rho_{\mathbb{A}_C, \mathbb{E}_C}$. Eve's total state conditioned on these outcomes becomes 
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\left.\mathbb{E} \given A\right.} = \rho_{\left.\mathbb{E}_B \given A_B\right.} \otimes \rho_{\left. \mathbb{E}_C \given A_C\right.}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\left.\mathbb{E}_B \given A_B\right.} = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \sum_{k=0}^3 \text{P}_B\left(A_B \given \beta_k, T_B\right) \dyad{\sqrt{1-T_B} \beta_k}_{\mathbb{E}_B}
\end{equation}
and similarly for $\rho_{\left.\mathbb{E}_C \given A_C\right.}$. The probability $\text{P}_B\left(A_B \given \beta_k, T_B\right)$ is calculated analogously to Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_channel_classical_prob}, and similarly for $A_C$.

Take $X_A = g A_B + h A_C$ as usual, with $g, h$ fixed, and write $A_C = \left(X_A - g A_B\right)/h$. Therefore we have

\begin{align}
\rho_{\left. \mathbb{E} \given X_A, A_B\right.} &= \frac{1}{16 \pi^2} \sum_{k, k^\prime = 0}^3 \text{P}_B\left(A_B \given \beta_k, T_B\right) \text{P}_C\left(\frac{X_A - g A_B}{h} \given \gamma_{k^\prime}, T_C\right) \notag \\
%
&\dyad{\sqrt{1-T_B} \beta_k}_{\mathbb{E}_B} \otimes \dyad{\sqrt{1-T_C}\gamma_{k^\prime}}_{\mathbb{E}_C}
\end{align}

\noindent Once again since Alice's function $F$ is in general not injective, we must mix over outcomes $A_B, A_C$ in order to find Eve's state $\rho_{\left.\mathbb{E} \given X_A\right.}$

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_aposteriori_state}
\rho_{\left.\mathbb{E} \given X_A\right.} = \int\limits_{A_B \in \mathbb{C}} \Diff2 A_B \; \text{P}\left(A_B\right) \rho_{\left.\mathbb{E} \given X_A, A_B\right.}
\end{equation}

\noindent and mixing over $X_A$ we finally reach

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_apriori_state}
\rho_{\mathbb{E}} = \int\limits_{X_A \in \mathbb{C}} \Diff2 X_A \; \text{P}\left(X_A\right) \rho_{\left.\mathbb{E}\given X_A\right.}.
\end{equation}

\noindent We may identity Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_aposteriori_state} as Eve's \emph{a prosteriori} state and Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_apriori_state} as Eve's \emph{a priori} state and so Eve's Holevo information is given by the usual formula

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:qss_holevo}
\chi = \text{S}\left(\rho_\mathbb{E}\right) - \int\limits_{X_A \in \mathbb{C}} \Diff2 X_A \; \text{P}\left(X_A\right) \text{S}\left(\rho_{\left.\mathbb{E} \given X_A\right.}\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent Let us explore the behaviour of Eve's Holevo information Eq.~\ref{eqn:qss_holevo}.

\MT{TODO: make some nice graphs of $\chi$ in different scenarios and under different attacks BS1, BS2, EC.}

\section{Security against a dishonest player}
\MT{Talk about guarding against a dishonest Bob/Charlie.}
Including a dishonest player, Bob or Charlie, in the above security proof requires us to re-calculate several quantities from the above section. For concreteness we will first assume that Bob is dishonest and Charlie is honest, and we allow Bob to collaborate with Eve. Later we will discuss how to account for the fact that we do not know \emph{which} player is dishonest.

The effect of including a dishonest player is that Bob knows precisely which coherent states he sent to Alice, and so he should have reduced uncertainty (increased Holevo information) about $X_A$. Intuitively it is also possible that Bob could wait and see which coherent states Charlie sent before choosing his own, in order to preference a certain outcome $X_A$. \MT{Make a comment about this. Would it be taken care of by Alice's optimization over $g, h$?} We will also assume that Bob sends states from his QPSK alphabet, though this could be relaxed in future work.

Since Bob knows which coherent states he sent we must re-calculate several expressions from the previous section. \MT{talk about which ones should be changed.}





























\section{Outlook}
\MT{this section should be somewhere else, perhaps in an "outlook" section?}
The classical post-processing of the above protocol is inherently very similar to Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017}, in which a secret key is generated between Alice and a shared Bob-Charlie degree of freedom via incompatible homodyne measurements on a tripartite entangled state. We expect that our protocol will be secure against a more restricted set of attacks, but over a wider range of channel parameters, for several reasons. 

Ref.~\cite{Kogias2017} has potentially dishonest players Bob and Charlie performing homodyne measurements on incompatible observables (i.e. switching between $q$ and $p$ quadratures). No assumptions are made about the measurement devices used and they are each treated as a "black-box". Security comes inherently because of a Heisenberg-type relation between incompatible observables, and the security proof relies on an Entropic Uncertainty Relation (EUR). These EURs have had success elsewhere in quantum cryptography \MT{cite}. However, since we desire to use heterodyne detection we are forced to adopt a different approach and explicitly model the states' evolution and measurement during the protocol. We note that this matches the current state-of-the-art of QPSK-based QKD, but can be improved in future work.

We have assumed that a dishonest Bob or Charlie still sends a state from the QPSK alphabet. It is yet unclear whether they could gain an advantage by sending something exotic and potentially highly entangled, perhaps in order to force Alice to reach a certain key $X_A$. This should be explored and potentially relaxed in future work. We anticipate that applying methods from quantum bit commitment might prove fruitful here. 

Finally, we note that our assumption that the channel between Alice and Bob-Charlie takes a tensor-product structure is perhaps a strong one and should be relaxed. A potential strategy of a dishonest player could be to exploit properties of a general channel which maps a two-mode input state to a two-mode output state at Alice, though potentially allowing a dishonest player many output ancilla modes correlated with Alice. Such a strategy will be restricted by the conditions that the reduced state of an honest player should be a coherent state. Similarly it will require that Alice's measurement outcomes don't look errant, though this should be quantified.
