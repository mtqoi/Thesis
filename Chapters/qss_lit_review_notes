Planning EB QSS lit review. Let's group together papers by key message.




EB QSS is possible:
Hillery1999, Karlsson1999, Cleve1999, Gottesman1999


Generalizing GHZ protocols:
Markham2008a (generalizes to graph states)
Keet2010 (generalizes to qudit graph states)
Lau2013 (generalizes to CV cluster states)
Armstrong2015 (links with QKD, links with steering)
Ottaviani2017b (links with quantum confering. Star-network. MDI)
Kogias2017 (unconditional security. CV)
	Xiang2017 (links with steering. optimal states)
	Xiang2018 (might allow the requisite entangled state to be distributed)
Chen2017b (based on BPB state)
Choi2017 (allows players to check whether a key has been distilled)
Xiao2004 (more players than HBB. More efficient)
Wu2016 (CV GHZ state for conferencing and qss. MDI)

Making EB QSS more practical:
Chen2005a (allows noisy ghz states)
Chen2005b (experiment with multipartite entanglement)
Lau2013 (generalizes to CV cluster states)
Williams2019 (polarization-entangled photon pairs)
Zhang2005b (uses bell-pairs instead of multipartite entanglement)
Karlsson1999 (uses bell-pairs instead of multipartite entanglement)

Experimental EB QSS:
Gartner2007 (QSS requiring four-photon entanglement)
Bell2014 (5-qubit graph state)
Tittel2001 (PM version of HBB using entangled PDC photons)
Chen2005b (experiment with multipartite entanglement)
