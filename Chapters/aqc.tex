\section{Introduction}

% Review some things from my previous two literature reviews
We have observed over the past two chapters, and in our overviews of quantum cryptography in Chapter~\MT{X}, that several quantum cryptographic protocols are intimately related. As Simmons noted

\MT{insert simmons quote}

and so we have seen close connections between QKD and QSS, and QSS may be interpreted simply as QKD performed between one player (dealer) and several players (recipients of the secret). We have also remarked that the secret sharing task may be performed pseudo-classically, by first encrypting channels using QKD and then using an unconditionally secure classical secret sharing protocol. 

It was noted \MT{cite some papers} that QSS is related to quantum conferencing and often the same hardware setup may be used to perform both tasks. And in Ref.~\MT{cite} it was explicitly demonstrated that a round-robin QSS protocol can also be used to perform QKD between any two players. Moving to the QDS literature, ever since discovery of practical QDS requiring neither quantum memory, entanglement or an optical multiport that there are close links between QDS and QKD. Ref.~\MT{cite} explicitly builds their QDS protocol to use QKD hardware, while Ref.~\MT{cite} realise a setup which can, with minimal hardware modification, perform either QDS or QKD, with additional MDI capabilities. And in Refs.~\MT{cite a bunch of stuff} it was explicitly remarked that QDS differs from QKD \emph{only} in the classical postprocessing. Finally, in Ref.~\MT{cite} the authors design their QSS scheme on the same principles as DPS QKD \MT{define and check}. And many papers build their security proofs on techniques designed for QKD \MT{cite loads of stuff.}

%We therefore might ask 

It should be clear that the field of quantum cryptography is far broader than mere QKD. As we move closer towards practical implementation of diverse quantum cryptographic protocols we must consider not only the unconditional security of the underlying protocol, but also its ease of implementation. As protocols are designed with minimal and often overlapping hardware requirements we may ask the question:
\\
\par
Q1:\emph{ given a particular hardware setup, which quantum protocols can I perform?}
\\
\\
\noindent Or, desiring a large-scale quantum cryptographic network:
\\
\par
Q2:\emph{ given a deployed network architecture, which quantum protocols can I perform with minimal disruption?}
\\
\\
\noindent Both of these questions have deep impacts on the success probability of a future large-scale quantum network. \MT{Chat more about the networks. Mention DV over installed fibers results from recent years. (Did they require dedicated hardware?)}

We have already even seen several quantum routes to accomplishment of the same task. By first utilizing QKD between all players it is possible to perform DS \MT{cite} or SS \MT{cite} using unconditionally secure classical algorithms, and indeed this may often be preferable to protocols requiring large entangled states \MT{cite}. Alternatively, in a distributed quantum computing setup which can easily generate and distribute entanglement, a protocol such as Ref.~\MT{cite} may be advantageous if it takes advantage of already accessible hardware. The comparison between different routes to the same task is rarely straightforward and is often more involved than simply comparing key rates.

In addition to consideration of performance of secure protocols, the questions Q1 and Q2 push us towards a consideration of security of well-performing protocols. Indeed, throughout the history of \emph{classical} cryptography, development of new cryptoystems have often occurred in response to the breaking of a system which was previously believed secure. Cynically, one could even view crpytographic history has a "cat-and-mouse" race between cryptographers and cryptanalysists: cryptographers trying to develop new protocols and harden their security; cryptanalysts endeavouring to secretly break them and intercept their messages. 

The replacement of a newly-insecure cryptosystem is difficult, expensive and time-consuming. In response to this problem in digital cryptography there has recently been a push towards so-called \emph{crypographic aglity} (crypto-agility), \MT{cite some stuff.} with a key motivator being the development of quantum computers. \MT{I want to mention somewhere the google chrome trial.} 

One of the main ideas in crypto-agility is the existence of a middleware which interacts both with the software application layer (user) and the underlying cypto-core (algorithm). This is accomplished in \MT{talk about the microsoft thing with .net and classes}. When the security of the underlying algorithm is weakened it becomes easy to simply replace the algorithm with a new or modified one, without changes to the rest of the computational architecture. Failures to allow a system to respond to new cryptographic threats like this can be at best embarrassing, and at worst costly or life-threatening. \MT{cite some IOT stuff from Bruce's blog.} The key idea of crypto-agility is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:agility}~(a).

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[draft=false]{aqc/Fig1-qagility}
\caption{\label{fig:agility} AQC paper figure 1. Made by Stefan. Talk about this figure some more.}
\end{figure}

The framework of classical crypto-agility seems ideal to help us answer Q1 and Q2. It is natural to separate the application layer (the task to be performed) from the underlying algorithm (which we may call a "quantum crypto-core"). One can envisage a future software library which can select the appropriate underlying algorithm based on the desired task to be performed and the available network resources.

\MT{Now, talk about different views of quantum agility, with reference to Fig.1}
\MT{I think I should only talk about CV+heterodyning and compatibility with infrastructure when I come to talk about the protocols, since it is in a sense a particular instance of the problems I am discussing in this section.}

%The following view of quantum crypto-agility (or quantum agility) can be thought of as analogous to a framework for quantum computing in which (this sentence doesn't really add much)

There are potentially two ways to translate classical crypto-agility into the quantum realm. We describe them both in Fig.~\ref{fig:agility}~(b, c). The first we refer to as QKD-assisted crypto agility which may be seen as a generalization of qCSS and the classical signatures protocols \MT{cite} which implicitly require QKD first in order to remain secure. The QKD system delivers fresh and secure random keys which may be used for many different protocols. This viewpoint is taken by the ETSI QKD ISG $004$ and $014$ standardization efforts \MT{cite} which specify the interface between a QKD system and the key management system. We expect that QKD-assisted crypto agility will form an important cornerstone for future quantum networks. This viewpoint on agility is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:agility}~(b).

However, as was shown in Ref.~\cite{Amiri2016} in the context of QDS, it is not always optimal to perform QKD + classical protocol, as there may be channels over which QKD is not possible, or hardware setups over which the costly reconciliation procedures are difficult. The second viewpoint may thus be referred to as a fully quantum crypto agility, Fig.~\ref{fig:agility}~(c). Rather than having an underlying QKD system, the setup has a "quantum network inferface card" (QNIC) which is able to perform multiple quantum communication protocols. This viewpoint is a generalization of the fact that multiple quantum cryptographic protocols differ only in classical postprocessing but share quantum stages. In this case the choice of protocol to perform is reduced simply to a firmware update. 

%\MT{Do I want a statement along the lines of "It is important to relaize that the transfer of the crypto-agility idea to the field of quantum cryptography changes its meaning..." from the paper?}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:big_agile} we present an example of an agile quantum communications stack of the viewpoint of Fig.~\ref{fig:agility}~(c). \MT{chat about this picture.}

\begin{figure}[htp]

\section{CV agile systems}
\MT{The text in this section is very close to Richter2020 section 3. I think this is fine, since I wrote it and had very little input or changes from other co-authors. But I should acknowledge this somewhere probably.}

To illustrate the above discussion, in this section we will introduce and analyse two quantum systems which are capable of performing multiple protocols over the same hardware setups, with difference only at the level of classical postprocessing. Our setups are designed with Q$2$ in mind and the desire that they be compatible with currently deployed network architecture. The systems therefore are fully continuous-variable, relying on distribution of phase-modulated QPSK coherent states and their heterodyne phase detection \MT{statement and reference about how this is what we see in networks.} which renders each system highly compatible with deployed telecommunications infrastructure. This paves the way to an integration between our agile systems into deployed communication links which run with up to $100$~GHz sending rate \MT{richer2020 cites some stuff here}. In the next section we will describe and analyse an experimental implementation of the agile systems discussed here, and discuss further how they accomplish quantum agility.

We will consider the following tasks:

\textbf{QDS - quantum digital signatures}: allows for secure authentication of a classical message. It has been explicitly demonstrated that because of its small overhead, QDS may run over channels for which QKD is insecure \cite{Amiri2016}.

\textbf{QSS - quantum secret sharing}: allows for secure distribution of a classical secret among a conspiracy of potentially dishonest recipients.

\textbf{QKD - quantum key distribution}: allows for secure key distribution of identical randomly-generated bits between players. These keys may them be used for encryption via OTP \MT{cite}.

The tasks QDS and QSS are discussed in Chapters \MT{X}, above, while the reader is referred to \MT{cite} for review of QKD. The tasks QDS and QSS are inherently multipartite, while QKD is inherently bipartite\footnote{Though note its multipartite generalization - quantum conferencing \MT{cite}.}. In what follows we will use quantum networks with three players to allow for multipartite tasks, while we explicitly describe how QKD may be performed over them.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics{aqc/agile_tasks.png}
\caption{\label{fig:agile_tasks} This figure should be analogous to Fig.3 from Richter2020.}
\end{figure}

We denote our two systems as \systemB and \systemF, see Fig.~\ref{fig:agile_tasks}. The labels indicate which of the above cryptographic tasks are supported; the underlying quantum states which they use, and in which direction the quantum states are exchanged ("f" - forward, Alice sends quantum states to Bob and Charlie; or "b" - backward, Bob and Charlie send quantum states to Alice). The forward- or backward- distinction can be seen as analogous to direct- or reverse-reconcilition in QKD \MT{cite some stuff}, in which quantum and classical information flow in the same direction or in opposite directions.

\MT{Perhaps have a table summarizing each system.}




\section{Agile system \systemB}
\MT{I'm not sure whether to discuss systemB or systemF first?}
The first agile system we consider relies on the $b$-configuration, Fig.~\ref{fig:agile_tasks}, in which Bob and Charlie are the senders of quantum states while Alice is the receiver. We immediately see that the QSS protocol proposed and analysed in Chapter~\MT{X} may be inherited into this agile system. For consistency with notation we will refer to it as QSS-$b$, and we will analyse it further below.

We also propose a second cryptographic protocol which fits into system \systemB, which may perform the QDS task. We refer to the protocol as QDS-$b$, and describe it below. Unlike the QDS protocol analysed in Chapter~\MT{X}, for QDS-$b$ it is Bob and Charlie who are the senders of quantum states, while Alice is the recipient. We will describe the protocol below, and then discuss how its security analysis must differ from Chapter~\MT{X}, and demonstrate how it fulfils QDS requirements $1-5$ from Chapter~\MT{X}.

Our first agile system \systemB is thus able to perform both QSS and QDS tasks using identical quantum resources. \MT{Say somewhere my nice line about the quantum stage being "agnostic" to final protocol}

\subsection{Protocol QDS-$b$}

\MT{I can have a picture about the QDS-b implementation.}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics{aqc/qdsb_setup.png}
\caption{\label{fig:qdsb_setup}}
\end{figure}

The protocol QDS-$b$ runs as follows:
\MT{Make sure it written analogously to QDS-$f$ above.}

\subsubsection*{Distribution stage}

\noindent \underline{Step $1$.} For each future message $m \in \left\{0, 1\right\}$ which Alice wishes to securely sign, Bob and Charlie create the classical strings
\begin{equation}
\Phi_m^{\left(B, C\right)} = \left\{\phi_{j, m}^{\left(B, C\right)}\right\}_{j=1}^L
\end{equation}
of length $L$, where the $\phi_j$ are complex phases chosen from QPSK alphabet $\mathcal{A}_4$. The $\phi_j$ are assumed to be drawn uniformly and at random from $\mathcal{A}_4$, but we relax this assumption later. 

%Bob and Charlie both send Alice a sequence, length $L$, of coherent states chosen randomly from the QPSK alphabet. Bob and Charlie each keep a record of which states they have sent.

\noindent \underline{Step $2$.} Bob and Charlie form sequences of quantum coherent states corresponding to elements of $\Phi_m^{\left(B, C\right)}$, analogously to Eqs.~\MT{X}, and distribute them through the quantum channels to Alice. Bob and Charlie each keep a record of $\Phi_m^{\left(B, C\right)}$.

\noindent \underline{Step $3$.} Alice performs heterodyne detection on each received state and receives complex phase outcomes which we denote $x_{B, C}^j \in \mathbb{C}$, with the subscript denoting which player send the coherent state. Since measurement is performed immediately on receipt of the state, Alice does not require quantum memory and the remainder of the protocol is entirely classical.

At the end of the quantum stage of the protocol, Alice possesses two classical strings, each of length $L$, which contain her complex phase measurements. She now forms eliminated signatures $A_{B, C}^m$ by writing down which two states from $\mathcal{A}_4$ are least-compatible with the $x_{B, C}^j$. The eliminated signatures are formed identically to Fig.~\MT{X}.

\noindent \underline{Step $4$.} \emph{Symmetrization:} Bob and Charlie swap a random half of their $\Phi_m^{\left(B, C\right)}$ in order to guard against a dishonest Alice. Bob (Charlie) now possesses signature $X_B^m, \left(X_C^m\right)$ which consists of two halves of length $L/2$, one of which was generated by Bob (Charlie), and one of whoch was received during the swapping. Denote the first half by $Y_m^{\left(B\right)}$ and the second half by $Z_m^{\left(B\right)}$ by analogy with Chapter~\MT{X}, and similarly for Charlie. The difference with Chapter~\MT{X} is that strings$Y_m^{\left(B\right)}$ and $Z_m^{\left(B\right)}$ contain phase information (they are essentially just a rearranged $\Phi_m^{\left(B, C\right)}$, while $A_{B, C}^m$ are eliminated signatures

\subsubsection{Messaging stage}
Messaging may occur any time after distribution.

\noindent \underline{Step $5$.} Alice sends the classical triplet $\Sigma = \left(m, \sigma_m\right)$ to Bob. The $m$ is the message she would like to convey, and her signature is $\sigma_m = \left(A_B^m, A_C^m\right)$. 

\noindent \underline{Step $6$.} Bob rearranges $\sigma_m \rightarrow \tilde{\sigma}_m := \left(\tilde{A}_{Y, m}^B, \tilde{A}_{Z, m}^B\right)$ by selecting elements from Alice's declaration which correspond to the two halves of his signature. Bob compares $\tilde{\sigma}_m$ to his two halves and counts the number of mismatches. Bob will accept $m$ as genuine provided that
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}\left(Y_m^B, \tilde{A}_{Y, m}^B\right) \le s_B \frac{L}{2} \qq{and} \mathcal{M}\left(Z_m^B, \tilde{A}_{Z, m}^B\right) \le s_B \frac{L}{2}
\end{equation}
otherwise the protocol aborts. The threshold $s_B$ in general takes a different value from the $s_B$ used in Chapter.~\MT{X}.

\noindent \underline{Step $7$.} If Bob has accepted $m$ then he forwards $\Sigma$ to Charlie, who similarly checks for mismatches between Alice's eliminated signature and his signature. Charlie accepts the message if
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}\left(Y_m^C, \tilde{A}_{Y, m}^C\right) \le s_C \frac{L}{2} \qq{and} \mathcal{M}\left(Z_m^C, \tilde{A}_{Z, m}^C\right) \le s_C \frac{L}{2}
\end{equation}
otherwise it aborts. The $s_C$ in general takes a different value from the $s_C$ in Chapter~\MT{X}. If both Bob and Charlie accept $m$ then the protocol has succeeded. 

It is worth noting some important similarities and differences between QDS-$b$ and the protocol described in Ch.~\MT{X}. While both protocols rely on QPSK alphabet and heterodyne detection, and while both protocols rely on the construction and comparison of an eliminated signature, the security analysis required for the two protocols differs. Crucially, while in Ch.~\MT{X} the $j^{\text{th}}$ element of a dishonest forger's declaration is a single phase chosen from QPSK, for QDS-$b$ he must effectively declare \emph{two} phases from QPSK (in the form of an eliminated signature element). Additionally, while QDS in Ch.~\MT{X} shares similarities with reverse-reconciliation QKD since a forging Bob had to guess Charlie's measurement outcomes, here QDS-$b$ shares similarities with direct-reconciliation QKD as a forging Bob will have to guess Charlie's sent state. We will later see how this affects performance of the protocol.

\subsection{QDS-$b$ security}
Let us consider the security of QDS-$b$ and check how it fulfils the requirements for a QDS protocol. 
\subsubsection{Security against repudiation}
Recall that during a repudiation attack Alice will try to cause Bob and Charlie to disagree about whether her message is genuine. Proof of security against repudiation follows identical lines to Chapter~\MT{X}.

We assume that Alice is free to manipulate her declared $A_{B, C}^m$ and she has full control over the mismatch rates $p_B \left(p_C\right)$ with respect to states she originally received from Bob and Charlie. Alice may even choose $p_B$ or $p_C$ to be zero. Security against repudiation arises from the Symmetrizaton step of the protocol. After Bob and Charlie have swapped classical information, they each possess two half-signatures, length $L/2$, consisting either of information which they held originally or which they received during swapping. Alice succeeds in her repudiation attack if Bob accepts both of his halves as genuine while Charlie rejects at least one of his halves as fake. Therefore the probability of successful repudiation is given by

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{\text{repudiation}} = \text{P}\left[\left(E_A \cap E_B\right) \cap \left(E_C \cup E_D\right) \right]
\end{equation}

\noindent where the events $E_A, E_B, E_C, E_D$ are defined as

\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}\left(Y_m^B, \tilde{A}_{Y, m}^B\right) \le s_B \frac{L}{2}, \notag \\
%
\mathcal{M}\left(Z_m^B, \tilde{A}_{Z, m}^B\right) \le s_B \frac{L}{2}, \notag \\
%
\mathcal{M}\left(Y_m^C, \tilde{A}_{Y, m}^C\right) > s_C \frac{L}{2}, \notag \\
%
\mathcal{M}\left(Z_m^C, \tilde{A}_{Z, m}^C\right) > s_C \frac{L}{2},
\end{align}
respectively.

Applying probability inequalities Eq.~\ref{eqn:prob_inequality_1},~\ref{eqn:prob_inequality_2} and Hoeffding's inequalities Eq.~\ref{eqn:hoeffding1},~\ref{eqn:hoeffding2} and following the analysis from Sec.~\MT{X} we see that

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{\text{repudiation}} \le \text{min}\left\{ 2 \; \exp\left(-\left[ p - s_B\right]^2 L\right), 2 \; \exp\left( - \left[ s_C - p\right]^2 L\right) \right\}
\end{equation}
\noindent 
provided that $s_B \le s_C$. The probability $\varepsilon_{\text{repudiation}}$ is maximized when
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{s_B + s_C}{2}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Finally,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:aqc_repudiation}
\varepsilon_{\text{repudiation}} \le 2 \; \exp\left( - \frac{\left[s_C - s_B\right]^2}{4}L\right)
\end{equation}
identically to Chapter~\MT{X}. We have seen that repudiation is only affected by relative mismatch rates between players' signatures and \emph{not} by who actually possesses the signatures. This is perhaps unsurprising since in both QDS-$b$ and earlier it is assumed that Alice has complete control over mismatch rates with respect to states held by players before swapping.

\subsection{Robustness}
The robustness of the protocol depends only on parameters $s_B$ and $\perr$. Using Hoeffding inequality Eq.~\MT{X} identically to Sec.~\MT{X}, we may derive 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:aqc_robustness}
\varepsilon_{\text{honest abort}} \le 2 \, \exp\left( - \left[s_B - \perr\right]^2 L\right)
\end{equation}
provided that $\perr \le s_B$. The probability $\perr$ of honest mismatch may be modelled as in Sec.~\MT{X} and does not change here.

\subsection{Security against forgery}
Since Bob already knows half of Charlie's signature elements (those which Bob himself forwarded) and since $s_B \le s_C$ the most dangerous forger is a dishonest Bob. He is therefore assumed to be the eavesdropper on Charlie's distribution of quantum states, and tries to gain information about the $L/2$ signature elements which Charlie generated himself.

Using Hoeffding's inequalities Eq.~\MT{X} as in Sec.~\MT{X} we see that at a forging attack succeeds with probability 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:aqc_forgery}
\varepsilon_{\text{forgery}} \le 2 \; \exp\left( - \left[ \pe - s_C\right]^2 \frac{L}{2} \right)
\end{equation}
provided that $\pe \ge s_C$. 

\subsection{Bounding $\pe$}
All that remains to do is to bound $\pe$. This will expose several of the differences between QDS-$b$ and QDS from Chapter~\MT{X}.

\MT{I am just copying and pasting the following from Richter2020. Which is fine because I wrote it and it hasn't been edited.}

Consider the $j^\text{th}$ signature element. Charlie holds some $c_j$ denoting which state from the QPSK alphabet he sent. Bob will declare an eliminated signature element, $B_j = \left\{b_j^1, b_j^2\right\}$ which is chosen to minimize $\pe$. The $b_j^1, b_j^2$ correspond to adjacent elements of the QPSK alphabet. A mismatch occurs if $b_j^1 = c_j$ or $b_j^2 = c_j$. Additionally, we assume that $B_j$ is the result of some optimal strategy involving Bob's quantum system, $\mathbb{B}_j$.

We define an error variable $\mathcal{E}$ such that 

\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:aqc_error}
\mathcal{E}_j = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $\mathcal{F}_j$ is eliminated in $\mathcal{G}_j$} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
which measures whether a mismatch has occurred between $\mathcal{F}_j$ and $\mathcal{G}_j$. Then $\pe \equiv \text{P}\left(\mathcal{E}_j = 1\right)$, and the Shannon entropy $\text{H}\left(\mathcal{E}_j\right) = \text{h}\left(\pe\right)$ is the binary entropy, since $\left|\mathcal{E}_j\right| = 2$. Now, consider the conditional entropy $\text{H}\left(\mathcal{E}_j, b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right)$. Via the chain rule for conditional entropies,

\begin{equation*}
\text{H}\left(\mathcal{E}_j, b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right) = \text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right)
\end{equation*}

\noindent where we have used the fact that once $b_j^1, b_j^2$ and $c_j$ are known, $\mathcal{E}_j$ is uniquely determined. Using the chain rule on $\text{H}\left(\mathcal{E}_j, b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right)$ again, but for a different variable, we get

\begin{align*}
\text{H}\left(\mathcal{E}_j, b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right) &= \text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given \mathcal{E}_j, c_j\right) + \text{H}\left(\mathcal{E}_j \given c_j\right) \notag \\
&\le \text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given \mathcal{E}_j, c_j\right) + \text{h}\left(\pe\right)
\end{align*}

\noindent since conditioning can never increase entropy. Therefore, by expanding the variable $\mathcal{E}_j$,

\begin{align*}
\text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right) \le &\left(1 - p_e\right) \text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given \mathcal{E}_j = 0, c_j\right) \\ + &\pe \text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given \mathcal{E}_j=1, c_j\right) + \text{h}\left(\pe\right).
\end{align*}

\noindent Now, $\text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given \mathcal{E}_j=0, c_j\right) \le \log_2\left(2\right) = 1$, and similarly for $\mathcal{E}_j=1$, and so

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:A7}
\text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right) \le 1 + \text{h}\left(p_e\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent Finally, we expand the conditional entropy in terms of the joint entropy and the mutual information,

\begin{align}\label{eqn:A8}
\text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 \given c_j\right) &= \text{H}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2\right) - \text{I}\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 : c_j\right) \notag \\
&\ge 2 - \chi\left(b_j^1, b_j^2 : c_j\right)
\end{align}

\noindent where we have used the fact that \emph{a priori} there are four choices for the pair $b_j^1, b_j^2$, and where $\chi$ is the Holevo information. Combining Eqs.~\MT{X},~\MT{X} we arrive at

\begin{equation}
\text{h}\left(\pe\right) \ge 1 - \chi
\end{equation}

\noindent \MT{add a comment about how this relates to QDSf}

Once $\pe$ and $\perr$ are bounded for the protocol, the probability $\varepsilon_{fail}$ that the protocol fails can be found. For concreteness, we assign equal probability to the failure of the protocol either by allowing a forging or repudiation attack, or by aborting when all players are honest, that is

\begin{equation*}
\varepsilon_{fail} = \varepsilon_{forg} = \varepsilon_{rep} = \varepsilon_{reject}
\end{equation*}

\noindent and by choosing $s_B = p_{err} + \left(p_e + p_{err}\right)/4$; $s_C = p_{err} = 3\left(p_e - p_{err}\right)/4$, in order to satisfy the second two equalities, we arrive at Eq.~(\ref{eqn:QDSbL}).

\begin{equation}
\varepsilon_{fail} \le 2 \exp \left[ - \frac{\left( p_e - p_{err} \right)^2}{16} L \right]
\end{equation}

\noindent when $\perr< s_B < s_C < \pe$.

\subsubsection{Calculating Holevo}

Finally, we note that under a beamsplitter attack, Eve's \emph{a priori} state is
\begin{equation}
\rho_E = \sum_{k=0}^3 |\sqrt{1-T}\alpha_k\rangle\langle\sqrt{1-T}\alpha_k|
\end{equation}
when states $|\alpha_k\rangle$ from the QPSK alphabet are sent through lossy channel with transmittivity T. Eve's \emph{a posteriori} state is simply $\rho_{E}^k = |\sqrt{1-T}\alpha_k\rangle\langle \sqrt{1-T}\alpha_k|$, from which her Holevo information is calculated as

\begin{equation}
\chi = S\left(\rho_E\right) - \sum_{k=0}^3 p\left(k\right) S\left(\rho_E^k\right).
\end{equation}
with $S$ the Von Neumann entropy.

\MT{Note: I will need to smooth out the above discussion and make it appropriate for use here.}
\MT{perhaps add some closing remarks or extra stuff to this section.}
\MT{gotta add some postselection stuff.}

\subsection{QDS-$b$ postselection}

\section{Agile system \systemF}
\MT{Let's start talking about the second agile system}

In addition to our first agile system described above, which is capable of switching between QDS and QSS tasks, we here introduce and demonstrate a second agile system, \systemF, which runs in the "f"-configuration Fig.~\ref{fig:agile_tasks} in which Alice is the sender of quantum states, while Bob and Charlie are the states' receivers. As hinted at by this second agile system's name, the system can perform both QDS and QKD tasks. The QKD task in particular already exists in the literature\footnote{Outside of the works which contribute to this Thesis} and so its inclusion demonstrates that pre-existing protocols may be interpreted through an agile lens.

We denote the two protocols as QDS-$f$ and QKD-$f$. QDS-$f$ was studied above in Chapter~\MT{X} and QKD-$f$ was recently analysed in Ref.~\cite{Papanastasiou2018}.

%The QKD task in particular has been the subject of intense study over the past two decades, and the protocol and security proof we utilize for \systemF may already

\subsection{Protocol QDS-$f$}
We leverage the QDS protocol considered in Chapter~\MT{X} to the system \systemF. The protocol, which we here denote QDS-$f$ requires no modification to run over hardware in the $f$-configuration and so the reader is referred to \MT{X} for details and security proof of the protocol. 

In Chapter~\MT{X} a security analysis was performed which assumed ideal behaviour. In Sec.~\MT{X} we relax some of these assumptions and make the protocol analysis more realistic to experimental implementation.

\subsection{Protocol QKD-$f$}
QKD using heterodyne detection of a distributed QPSK alphabet has long been proposed and analysed, owing to its ease of implementation and high compatibility with installed telecommunications infrastructure. \MT{Brief literature review of attempts to analyse security}

A QKD protocol relying on these resources is analysed in Ref.~\cite{Papanastasiou2018}, and it is their analysis which we continue with in this section. 

\MT{Q: how much of this paper should I include?}

%\MT{I should make some graphs and talk about the performance of this protocol. (How close to a lit-review should it be?) <- ahhhh, perfomance will go in the next section}

\section{Performance of CV agile systems}
Let us now consider the theoretical performance of the protocols which contribute to the above agile systems. \MT{Perhaps at some point I should analyse optimal $\alpha$'s for protocols which run on the same system}
\MT{TODO: decide on which graphs to make, and what the story will be here.}

\section{Experimental implementation}
\MT{Briefly describe the experiment and what data I received. I want to make this section stuff which I \emph{didn't} do, so the next section can be stuff which I have actually done.}

An experiment which investigates the above two agile systems was performed at \MT{X} \cite{Richter2020}. Specifically, two optical sender and receiver modules were used to implement the four protocols described above. A sender module (Tx) generates and distributes phase-encoded coherent states chosen from the QPSK alphabet, while a receiver module (Rx) performs heterodyne detection of the received states' phase. Depending on the required configuration, the modules Tx, Rx are variously interpreted as playing roles of Alice or Bob/Charlie, Fig.~\ref{fig:agile_tasks}.

\subsubsection{Sender module (Tx):} The sender module is depicted in Fig.\ref{fig:aqc_experiment}. An external cavity diode laser (PurePhotonics PPCL-$300$ \MT{cite}) with a linewidth of $15$~kHz is tuned to standard telecom wavelength $1550$~nm and acts as the optical carrier. The carrier beam impinges on a $50:50$ beamsplitter which allows for a shared local oscillator (LO) between modules from one output port. From the other output port  coherent state pulses, chosen randomly from QPSK alphabet $\left\{ \ket{+ \alpha_0}, \ket{i \alpha_0}, \ket{-\alpha_0}, \ket{-i \alpha_0}\right\}$, are prepared by using an I/Q modulator (Fujitsu DP-QPSK $40$~Gbps $LiNbO_3$-integrated)\MT{I'm not sure which word "integrated" should be attached to here}. The I/Q modulator is driven at a rate of $1$~GHz by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG; Keysight M$8195$A). Finally, a variable optical attenuator (VOA) attenuates the coherent states to a final amplitude of either $\alpha$ or $\alpha^\prime$, with $\alpha \le \alpha^\prime \le \alpha_0$.

The coherent states are then sent through the quantum channel to receiver module Rx.

\subsubsection{Receiver module (Rx):}
Module Rx interferes the received states with the shared local oscillator using the integrated Kylia COH$24$-X $90\si{\degree}$ \MT{what is this?}. The two modules use a shared local oscillator which provides a frame of reference against which heterodyne phase measurement is performed using two balanced optical receivers (Discovery DSC-R$412$) with analog $3$~dB bandwidth of $20$~GHz \MT{what is this?}. In principle the Tx and Rx modules do not need to share a local oscillator and bright phase-reference pulses could be used \MT{cite some stuff.}\footnote{Chat about security loopholes of using shared LO.}

Outputs from the optical receivers are digitized using a digital sampling oscilloscope (Tektronix DPO$77002$SX) with a sampling rate of $25$~GS/s. Finally, proprietary digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms are applied to the quadrature time traces. The DSP consists of a high-pass filter which eliminates low-frequency noise contributions to the signal. Finally, a phase-recovery step is performed using phase-reference states which originally had amplitude $\alpha^\prime$. The signal states carrying quantum information which may now be used for a quantum communications task are those which originally had amplitude $\alpha$.

The Tx and Rx modules were connected by either a $2$~km or $20$~km SMF-$28$ optical fiber link which contributes to a total loss of $0.65$~dB or $4.75$~dB, respectively. This implements the realistic metropolitan distances over which the CV platform is expected to be effective. Experiments were performed for several different signal state modulation amplitudes $\alpha$. For each run of the experiment a total of $1.92\times 10^6$ states were sent in frames of $64$ which consisted of four bright reference pulses ($\alpha^\prime$) followed by $60$ signal pulses ($\alpha$). After the DSP step there remained information on $1.54 \times 10^6$ states.
